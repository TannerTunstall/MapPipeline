<h3>ICE Out For Good New Braunfels</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, January 31, 2026 at 10:00 AM CST - 12:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>301 Main Plaza<br>New Braunfels, TX 78130</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Wednesday, January 7th, an American citizen was killed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Minneapolis, Minnesota. This killing is part of a broader pattern of unchecked violence, impunity, and abuse carried out by federal immigration enforcement agencies against members of our communities. 

A broad coalition of groups across the country is calling for a coordinated Ice Out For Good Weekend of Action on Saturday, January 10th and Sunday, January 11th to demand accountability, honor the life lost, and make visible the human cost of ICE’s actions. 

A core principle behind all ICE Out For Good events is a commitment to nonviolent action and no civil disobedience. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values, and to act lawfully at these events. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events. All events should be held in public spaces or on public property.

Indivisible is managing data and communications with participants. By registering, you agree to receive info from Indivisible about the event, receive communications via e-mail or SMS message from Indivisible, and receive any other updates and opportunities to take action or support ICE OUT FOR GOOD partner organizations.

<h3>Dems and Friends Thursday Ice House Crawl</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Thursday, January 29, 2026 at 6:00 PM CST - 8:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Dos Sirenos Brewing<br>231 E Cevallos St<br>San Antonio, TX 78204</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Bexar County Democrats</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Every Thursday, 6-8 PM, we go to a different place with a laid back vibe just to schmooze and find out who&apos;s who. We also discover ice houses and other neighborhood watering holes that tell us a story about San Antonio history and culture.

Now more than ever we need to get together and visualize how we are going to build a rock solid team to Get Out the Vote in 2026. We think the best way to start is by having fun. A laid back vibe and good beer, interesting casual conversation, some good food, and VOILA! Fun and friends! 

The Crawls and the Dems are going to be bigger, better and bolder right here, right now. So we&apos;re looking for new friends to join the old. Bring someone with you, meet someone new as well as getting together with old friends for a good mix and mingle. If you&apos;re curious about what Democrats are about, this is a good way to learn about them in a natural habitat.

This is a low expectation event--no hard start or stop time--come and go when you feel like it--no sitting in one spot, no listening to speakers, no pressure to volunteer, not even talking about politics unless you want to.  All you have to do is say hi to someone you don&apos;t know and be nice.</p>

        <name>ICE OUT PROTEST AND VIGIL</name>
        <description><![CDATA[
<h3>ICE OUT PROTEST AND VIGIL</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, January 31, 2026 at 4:00 PM CST - 7:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Shepler Square Park<br>406 W Gore Blvd<br>Lawton, OK 73501</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> VETERANS UNITED FOR ACTION</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>I am angry. I know you are too. And I’m scared.

What’s happening in Minneapolis will spread, unless we work to stop it.

NSPM-7 (National Security Presidential Memorandum) designates people like you and me, like Renee Good and Alex Pretti, as “the enemy within.” 

ICE and CBP will murder, brutalize, kidnap and detain peaceful protesters, legal observers, people just trying to take their kid to school or go to work, and Kristi Noem and Stephen Miller will automatically call them “domestic terrorists.”

These protesters are trying to protect immigrants, and people who LOOK like immigrants, from being kidnapped by ICE, unlawfully detained, brutalized, and deported. Immigrants and U.S. Citizens are subject to their “shoot first, ask questions later” tactics.

We are told not to believe what we saw.

We are told not to resist.

But we must. We are angry, but we MUST stay peaceful. The regime wants an excuse to invoke the Insurrection Act and martial law. We cannot give it to them.

If it weren’t for our winter storm, we’d be out there today protesting. But next weekend’s weather will be 52 degrees. Come to Shepler Park, 4th and Gore, Sat. Jan 31.

From 4-6 pm we will protest. Bring signs, bullhorns, chants, songs, and your passion for justice.

At 6 pm we will hold a vigil. Bring battery-powered candles, small flashlights, or cell phones or other lights. Please do not bring anything with a flame. I will have several battery candles for those who don’t have any.

During the vigil, if someone wants to pray, we will pray. If someone wants to speak, we will listen. If someone wants to read a poem or lead us in a song, we will support. 

We must be non-violent. Do not bring weapons of any kind, except for your voices.

The City of Lawton has an ordinance that requires a paid permit for any assembly (specifically protests) of more than 24 people. Keep that in mind. 

The City Council will address our opposition to this ordinance on Tues. Jan. 27 at the end of their meeting. If you want to speak during Audience Participation on this or any topic of concern, be sure you have submitted a Request to Speak BEFORE the meeting starts. Submit to the city clerk either at the meeting or email to her (and be sure she responds that she has received it.)

https://mobilize.us/s/Mg9M9L for detailed information about the agenda items and how to participate.

You can also do your own protest/vigil at other visible locations. 38th and Gore has easy parking and good traffic, for one.

To learn about successful non-violent resistance, watch the short documentaries in this series, particularly the first one on the Civil Rights Movement: https://www.mobilize.us/indivisible/event/878852/ 

Heather Cox Richardson explains it in her usual level-headed, well-researched fashion. Listen and weep. Then get up and go to work saving democracy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2501T81PR38  

A great protest song:
https://youtu.be/4PUOhAJG5EU?si=cn-lhMIDFr5qfgz4 (Thanks, Al G.!)

Please let me know if you have any ideas about the protest or the vigil. 

Let’s keep making Good Trouble.</p>

<h3>ICE OUT FOR GOOD - NO DHS FUNDING FOR 2026!</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Monday, January 26, 2026 at 3:30 PM CST - 4:30 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Sen. Michael Bennet&apos;s Pueblo office<br>129 W B St<br>Pueblo, CO 81003</p>

<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>A protest will be held in front of Senator Michael Bennet&apos;s Pueblo office with signs, protest songs and chants. We will also honor Renee Good and Alex Pretti&apos;s memories.

The senseless killing in Minneapolis of Renee Good and Alex Pretti has revealed I.C.E.&apos;s unchecked brutality. WE DEMAND ALL DEMOCRATIC SENATORS VOTE THIS WEEK TO DEFUND D.H.S. IN THE FY 2026 BUDGET. We demand that I.C.E. follow the law and stop racially profiling, arresting, brutalizing and killing law-abiding immigrants and protesters. We also agree with Senator Bennet that DHS Secretary Kristi Noem MUST RESIGN.</p>

<h3>Pretti Good Reasons to Protest! ICE OUT OF EVERYWHERE!</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, January 27, 2026 at 2:00 PM CST - 4:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Horizon Events Center<br>2100 NW 100th St<br>Clive, IA 50325</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>The president is coming to Des Moines at Congressman Nunn&apos;s request. 

Join us in peaceful protest!

Who knows what he will rant about; the economy, Greenland, or Venezuela? Or his growing collection of unearned trophies, medals and awards. 



Regardless, we won&apos;t hear it because we&apos;ll be outside exercising our first amendment rights, demanding:

1. Justice for Pretti, for Good, and all who have been harmed

2. ICE out of EVERYWHERE! No funding for ICE and DHS in spending bill (Nunn already voted yes, contact Ernst and Grassley to rein in ICE, no $)

3. NO to State and local law enforcement cooperating with ICE. Tell your State Rep. and Senator, &quot;we don&apos;t want our public safety officers coordinating with ICE)

and obey the law!!! RELEASE THE EPSTEIN FILES NOW! 

Please keep checking this space! Final details will be coming out as we know more about access near the venue.

We will be outside! So dress for the weather. 
Parking will be challenging so please carpool.

Depending on street access, we may be able to caravan/funeral procession (death of democracy) near the venue.

And as always....***A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values and to act lawfully at these events. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events.***</p>

<h3>IND Cobb - ICE Out for Good @ HD HQ</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, January 31, 2026 at 12:00 PM CST - 1:30 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>The Home Depot Store Support Center<br>2455 Paces Ferry Rd SE<br>Atlanta, GA 30339</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Cobb</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>ICE continues to escalate their brutality and lawless behavior. We will continue to stand up and send the message ICE Out for Good.

We are gathering at Home Depot’s headquarters to demand that the company end its cooperation with ICE and stop allowing immigration enforcement to target day laborers on or near its properties.

For years, Home Depot parking lots have functioned as informal hiring sites for day laborers, many of whom are immigrants seeking honest work to support their families. By permitting ICE access to these spaces, Home Depot enables the intimidation, detention, and deportation of workers who are simply trying to survive.

Corporations do not exist outside of moral responsibility. When a company allows its property to be used as a site of immigration enforcement, it becomes complicit in harm - tearing families apart, destabilizing communities, and contributing to fear and exploitation of workers.

We are calling on Home Depot to:
* Prohibit ICE enforcement actions on its property
* Publicly commit to protecting day laborers from targeting and harassment
* Take responsibility for the real human consequences of its policies

This rally is about dignity, accountability, and the right to seek work without fear. We stand in solidarity with immigrant workers and demand that Home Depot choose people over profit and justice over convenience.

PARKING:
Best options are Panera, La Quinta and Fairfield hotel.
Please try to patron somewhere in the area, like Panera.
We will meet on public sidewalks at the intersection of Paces Ferry Rd and Spring Hill Pkwy.

***A core principle behind all ICE Out For Good events is a commitment to nonviolent action and no civil disobedience. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values, and to act lawfully at these events. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events. All events should be held in public spaces or on public property.***</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
<h3>Rally with AJDems ICE OUT FOR GOOD</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 7, 2026 at 9:00 AM CST - 12:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Apache Juction Marker<br>South Phelps Drive &amp; East Old West Highway<br>Apache Junction, AZ 85119</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Pinal County Democratic Party</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>The Ice Out for Good Rally is not a quiet gathering — it’s a surge of collective power. This is where people who are tired of being ignored, dismissed, or frozen out of the political process come together to melt the old barriers and ignite something new. The rally channels frustration into purpose, turning cold discontent into blazing determination. Voices rise, energy builds, and the message is unmistakable: communities are done waiting for change. They’re ready to demand it.

This event is a rallying cry for everyone who refuses to sit on the sidelines. It’s a space for bold ideas, unapologetic passion, and the kind of unity that shakes the ground beneath complacency. Attendees will connect with organizers who are pushing for fairness, accountability, and a political future shaped by people — not by apathy or inertia. Ice Out for Good is about breaking through the freeze, lighting a fire under civic engagement, and pushing forward with unstoppable momentum. This is the moment to stand up, speak out, and fuel a movement that refuses to cool down.

Meet at our usual corner of Phelps and Old West Hwy. in Apache Junction from 8am-11am. Please stay hydrated and bring water. :-) PLEASE PARK IN THE DIRT LOT ON THE NORTHEAST CORNER OF PHELPS AND OLD WEST HWY.</p>

There were approx. 135 287(g) agreements when Biden left office. There are now 1000+ active agreements in the US and growing under the Trump administration. 

- Mesa PD and ICE have had a 287(g) agreement since 2009

- Reports prove that these agreements lead to racial profiling and civil rights abuses

<h3>❌🧊 ICE OUT for Good - Weekly Protest in Surprise AZ</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, January 31, 2026 at 10:00 AM CST - 11:30 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Bell Road &amp; North Civic Center Drive<br>Surprise, AZ 85374</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Northwest Valley Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>### **Weekly Protest: Stop ICE Overreach**

📍 **Bell Rd &amp; Civic Center Dr, Surprise, AZ**  
🕘 **Every Saturday | 9:00–10:30 AM**

We are protesting weekly in Surprise in response to the ongoing overreach of ICE in Minnesota, across the country, and right here in Arizona.

*A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values and to act lawfully at these events. Weapons of any kind should not be brought to events.*

As residents of **Arizona’s 8th Congressional District**, we are calling on our representative, **Abe Hamadeh**, to publicly address and oppose federal enforcement actions that endanger civil rights and community safety. Protecting constituents from government overreach is a core responsibility of elected office.

**Our demands:**

- No new funding for ICE without real reform  
- Investigate the killing of Renee Good
- End aggressive dragnet operations and mass surveillance  
- Restore transparency, accountability, and due process  

**Suggested messages for signs:**

- JUSTICE FOR RENEE GOOD  
- FREEZE ICE FUNDING  
- END ICE NOW  
- BELIEVE YOUR EYES NOT TRUMP’S LIES  
- NO ICE IN AZ  
- DUE PROCESS FOR ALL  

This protest is rooted in **nonviolence, clarity, and solidarity**. We welcome community members who believe no agency should operate above the law and that state power must be constrained by constitutional rights and public oversight.

**Bring signs, bring water, and bring your voice.**

**Parking:** Plenty of parking is available on the south side of Bell Rd. Please stay out of the urgent care parking lot at the corner and avoid parking near business entrances.

**Peaceful protest. No violence. No harassment. No escalation.**

—Muncie Resists Progressive Discussion Group Team

For this month’s discussion, we’ll discuss **community responses to ICE activity and immigration enforcement**. We ask that you read this recent [article](https://www.thenation.com/article/activism/communities-grassroots-resistance-ice/#) that highlights how neighbors across the country are organizing to protect one another, share information, and build systems of mutual aid. The piece looks at grassroots efforts and what resistance can look like at the local level.

Come ready to listen and share your perspective. As always, our goal is thoughtful, respectful dialogue and learning together.

Here is a [link] (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VOaSMp6HM7YFx5okS-XQXVIvDhL0e21h/view?usp=sharing) to a pdf of the article!</p>

<h3>ICE OUT FOR GOOD AND PRETTI! Burlington</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, January 31, 2026 at 11:00 AM CST - 12:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Parking lot across the street from Veterans Terrace<br>589 Milwaukee Ave<br>Burlington, WI 53105</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> WisDems</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>On Saturday, January 31, at 11:00 am, we will meet in the parking lot across the street from Veterans Terrace, 589 Milwaukee Avenue, Burlington, WI. Our event will run from 11:00 am to noon.

Please bring your signs, cameras, and whistles if you have them. Come to meet and support one another. As you walk around, please take the opportunity to introduce yourself to others and make some new friends. Let’s show our solidarity to keep ICE out of our cities and towns. I know the warmth you show each other will help keep all of us safe and hopefully melt the ice!

A core principle of all our rally events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values and to act lawfully at these events. Weapons of any kind, including those that are legally permitted, should not be brought. We must protect everyone’s safety. If someone yells profanity or insults at you, please ignore them and walk away. Do not respond or engage. Do not yell or swear back. Please find me (Jan) if you have any issues.

Please park on the surrounding streets in Burlington or in a nearby parking structure. If you are less able to walk, you may park in the rally parking lot. The weather on Saturday looks okay but rather cold, at about 18 ºF.

If you have not made a sign yet, the Burlington Democrats office will be open on Saturday morning from 10:00 to 11:00 am. They will have sign-making materials available. The office is located at the very west end of Low Daily, 700 N. Pine Street (about three blocks away).

When you arrive, please stop at the registration table to check in. I look forward to seeing you again and thanking you in person.

See you Saturday!
Jan</p>

<h3>Ice Out For Good - Brookfield WI</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, January 31, 2026 at 10:30 AM CST - 12:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Thomas Lane &amp; West Bluemound Road<br>Brookfield, WI 53005</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Brookfield Resist</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>We’ve seen video after video of Kristi Noem’s terror squads in Minneapolis, the flagrant racial profiling of innocent people on the street—demanding that American citizens, including police officers and Native Americans, show their papers, and even detaining some. We&apos;ve seen the murder of Renee Good, the gassing and clubbing of people for exercising their First Amendment rights, and now the gangland style killing of Alex Jeffrey Pretti—a 37-year-old ICU nurse trying to help a woman knocked to the ground.

And all that Kristi Noem can do is spew lie after lie about what really happened despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary. The Fascists in charge are slowly tightening their grip on our freedoms and democracy. When Fascism takes over – you will have no rights.

Stand with us this weekend to reject Trump, his administration, and the spineless Republicans in Congress for allowing this to go on.</p>

<h3>Candlelight Walk &amp; Vigil in Solidarity with Minneapolis</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Wednesday, January 28, 2026 at 5:30 PM CST - 6:30 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Mequon City Hall<br>11333 N Cedarburg Rd<br>Mequon, WI 53092</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Ozaukee Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Saturday, January 24th  Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old ICU nurse at a Minneapolis VA hospital, a US citizen, and an ICE observer, put his body between two women and the ICE agents who were brutalizing them. Pretti, a US citizen, was exercising his First Amendment right to protest ICE raids, he was also exercising his Second Amendment right to carry a firearm, which he was licensed to do. As he was pepper-sprayed in the face, at least six ICE agents pulled him to the ground and began to kick and beat him. Within 30 seconds of placing his body between those women and the ICE agents, Alex Pretti had been shot 10 times in the back. 

DHS Secretary Kristi Noem accused Alex of committing an “act of domestic terrorism” – as the Administration did after an ICE agent shot and killed Renee Good on January 7 – while President Donald Trump blamed Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey for Pretti’s death, saying they “are inciting Insurrection”. Meanwhile, eyewitness video shows an ICE agent disarm Pretti and walk away with Pretti’s handgun moments before the other officers fire 10 rounds into his back. He is the third person gunned down by ICE in less than 3 weeks.  We will honor these lives that have been lost to this senseless violence and demand justice for all victims of ICE.

We ask that you join us on Wednesday, January 28th, at 5:30pm. We will gather in the parking lot behind Mequon City Hall near the entrance to the Interurban Bike path.  Please bundle up, bring a candle and join us for a Silent Candlelight Walk in remembrance of Alex Pretti, Renee Good, Keith Porter, and everyone who&apos;s been killed, kidnapped, or terrorized by ICE. Our path will take us on the bike trail, then East on Mequon Rd, and loop back to City Hall.  We will cross at that crosswalk and join any friends waiting for us at the corner of Mequon Rd &amp; Cedarburg Rd, where we will hold a short vigil. If you prefer not to join us for the walk, you can head straight to the corner with your candle. We will have a safety person waiting to greet you. Thank you for joining us in standing firm that this violence must stop!

An ICE Out solidarity protest will also be held on Saturday, 1/31 in Grafton from 10-11am.  Please visit OzaukeeIndivisible.org for details and to be added to our email list for future events.

As always, Ozaukee Indivisible is committed to nonviolent civic engagement. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values and to act lawfully at these events. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events.</p>

<h3>ICE OUT for GOOD - Bridge Brigade Visibility Action</h3>

<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Overpass adjacent to Lucy Winton Bell Fields<br>15601 Hudson Rd N<br>Lake Saint Croix Beach, MN 55043</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Afton Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>About this event:

Wednesday, January 7th, a fellow Minnesotan was killed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Minneapolis, Minnesota. This killing is part of a broader pattern of unchecked violence, impunity, and abuse carried out by federal immigration enforcement agencies against members of our communities.

A broad coalition of groups across the country is calling for a coordinated Ice Out For Good Weekend of Action on Saturday, January 10th and Sunday, January 11th to demand accountability, honor the life lost, and make visible the human cost of ICE’s actions.

We are all Renee.

A core principle behind all ICE Out For Good events is a commitment to nonviolent action and no civil disobedience. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values, and to act lawfully at these events. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events. All events should be held in public spaces or on public property.

A core principle of all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. Participants are expected to de-escalate any potential confrontation.

On Wednesday, January 7th, an American citizen was killed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Minneapolis, Minnesota. This killing is part of a broader pattern of unchecked violence, impunity, and abuse carried out by federal immigration enforcement agencies against members of our communities. 

A core principle behind all ICE Out For Good events is a commitment to nonviolent action and no civil disobedience. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values, and to act lawfully at these events. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events. All events should be held in public spaces or on public property.

Indivisible is managing data and communications with participants. By registering, you agree to receive info from Indivisible about the event, receive communications via e-mail or SMS message from Indivisible, and receive any other updates and opportunities to take action or support ICE OUT FOR GOOD partner organizations. You also agree to have any data entered in this registration collected by Indivisible. Indivisible will treat your data according to our organization’s applicable privacy policy: https://indivisible.org/privacy-policy</p>

<h3>ICE Protest Cathedral City</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Sunday, February 1, 2026 at 12:00 PM CST - 1:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Outside Arco/AMPM<br>67625 E. Palm Canyon Dr.<br>Cathedral City, CA 92234</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> ResistTrump Campaign</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Join our regular #CoachellaResists Sunday action to protest ICE abuses and all the authoritarian actions of the Trump administration. ICE Out for Good!

Coachella Valley Arco/AMPM locations are owned by [local millionaire Trump megadonor Nachhattar Chandi](https://capitalandmain.com/trumps-california-henchmen-golden-state-business-enablers-0531). 

Every Sunday, we demonstrate outside Arco/AMPM and encourage people to boycott -- walk, bike, take the bus, carpool, drive an EV, or drive less, or go to another station, but let&apos;s show pro-Trump corporations that supporting oppression and secret police is not profitable! 

**This week, let&apos;s meet afterward to discuss future actions and how we can organize lawfully and nonviolently in Coachella Valley. Meeting place will be sent after signups.** 

See you Sunday! 

--------------------------------------------------------------

Nonviolent civil resistance has worked against dictators and authoritarian regimes - it worked for Gandhi, MLK, the Serbian democracy activists of the 1990s, and others. (https://www.nonviolent-conflict.org/about/civil-resistance/)

Our new volunteer group #CoachellaResists, is part of the #ResistTrump Campaign.

#ResistTrump&apos;s vision is a world without Trump and his enablers in power -- and the campaign aims to achieve that via lawful, nonviolent civil resistance. Its values are Collaboration, Integrity, Nonpartisanship, and Professionalism.

At Sunday&apos;s protest, we&apos;ll talk about further productive action.

See you there!</p>

<h3>Feet on the Streets - with a twist - tell Home Depot to get I C E out</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Friday, January 30, 2026 at 11:00 AM CST - 7:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Home Depot near Costco<br>725 Plaza Ct<br>Chula Vista, CA 91910</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>*A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*

Hi Everyone:

I&apos;m trying to think out of the box for ways to utilize Indivisible to organize a lot of Good Trouble ... 

You might have all heard about the badass warriors who made a point of all going to Home Depot to purchase an *ice scraper* with a CREDIT CARD if you can ... and then standing back in line 5 minutes later to return it ... (google it - people are so creative) .

***NEW IDEA***. Same thing, but buy a few screws with your credit card (it adds fees for HD) ... then when you return it a few minutes later, tell the employee to SCREW ICE ... make sure they know the reason you are returning !!!!

Well, how about we all just do that at our own leisure? 

I tried it last week - it was a success, and it made me feel better LOL ...

Here is what you can do ... as often as you can manage it ... work it into your routines if you have to!   I plan on doing it after my protests - on the way home !  

Go to Home Depot ... walk around and &quot;shop&quot; for as long as you want -- I like to go and just PAY ATTENTION -- I now know exactly what they look like from the hotel protests - I hear they like to cosplay as construction workers to fit in!  (they still stick out like a sore thumb in my book).  Have a WHISTLE ready to warn people if you see anything sus .......

Buy California&apos;s version of an &quot;ice scraper &quot;   I bought a small putty knife for 98 cents ...   ***NEW IDEA ... buy a few screws and return them saying SCREW ICE!!!***

PAY by your CREDIT CARD if you can - for extra bonus points (they get charged a fee no matter what is purchased with a credit card -- win win) ...

Then, immediately walk right back in the store and go to the Customer Service line to RETURN it !

I told the nice lady (remember it is NOT the employees fault their employers are not-c&apos;s ...kindness matters), that I was returning this &quot;ice scraper&quot; in solidarity with my friends in the community - to send a message that we do not welcome thugs into our neighborhoods to terrorize our friends!    All with a smile on my face ... she almost cried when she said, I totally understand !!   and happily returned my buck back to my credit card ...

ANYONE can make this happen -- if you are looking for a way to RESIST with us, but being on a street corner is intimidating (no judgment, we all do what we feel comfy with), well THIS little Good Trouble Causing mission is for you!!!

Bonus points if you then post about it on your social media platforms to encourage others to do this simple act!

They shut down a Home Depot (upper Cali) when they had 100&apos;s of people doing this AT THE SAME TIME ...

So, for now, let&apos;s just do it on our own ... whenever you can!

*Next up:  an actual protest in front of that same Home Depot - maybe we can coordinate it to do the ice scraper thing first, and then protest them afterward ... either on the main road, or right in front of their store ...........*

<h3>Central Plaza South</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, January 27, 2026 at 4:00 PM CST - 6:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Central Plaza South<br>Central Plaza S<br>Canton, OH 44702</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Stark Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Emergency Protest: Stop ICE Terror

ICE violence is out of control in this country. In recent weeks they have killed Renee Nicole Good and Alex Pretti while in custody, and at least 38 more people have died under ICE supervision. This is state-sanctioned terror, and it MUST stop!!

We’re not just here to protest, we’re here to demand real accountability and concrete political action!

Join us this Tuesday in Canton at 5 PM in Central Plaza for an Emergency Protest with Stark Indivisible and the PSL.

We’ll march, make our voices heard, and demand:

 - Accountability for the deaths of Renee Good, Alex Pretti, and everyone
    murdered under ICE custody
 - That U.S. Senators do not vote to fund ICE in the coming week.
 - An end to federal violence in our communities and a halt to enforcement
    operations that terrorize families and neighborhoods.


Details:
📍 Central Plaza, Canton
🗓 Tuesday, Jan 27
⏰ 5:00 PM start

It’s going to be cold. Dress warm, bring hot drinks if you want, and layer up. If the weather turns dangerous, we may reschedule and will update everyone ASAP.

Bring:

warm clothes &amp; sturdy shoes
signs and energy
friends, neighbors, neighbors’ friends

This moment demands more than sadness. It demands action, visibility, and pressure on elected leaders to block funding for this violence and hold agents and policymakers to account.

We’ll see you there. Stand firm. Stand loud.</p>

<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> NE Oakland Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>## Congress must write a DHS appropriations bill that puts serious restrictions on ICE, ends its dragnet raids, and doesn’t add a penny to its already bloated budget. 

### Every MoC must publicly oppose a DHS appropriations bill that fails to meet this moment! CALL AND WRITE THEM DAILY

▶️ **We are outraged by the killing of Alex Pretti and Renee Good by ICE and Border Patrol. We grieve their deaths and the deaths of all those killed in ICE detention.**


▶️ **ICE has been escalating its cruel deployments into our communities.** *This recent killing is not an isolated incident, but the devastating and predictable result of ICE’s lawless operations and President Trump’s abuse of power.*


▶️ **We demand accountability and not one penny more for ICE.** *Congress must reject funding increases in the DHS appropriations bill and rein in ICE and Border Patrol.*


**The Bill MUST**


▶️ **Strengthen restrictions on ICE and Border Patrol’s ability to conduct dragnet arrest operations and target people based on their race, language or accent, place of employment, or location at the time of the apprehension.** *These agencies have secretively created a mass surveillance apparatus that uses dragnet techniques to forcibly collect and track biometric data on American citizens and immigrants alike without any legislative, judicial, or public oversight.*


▶️ **End Border Patrol deployment to our cities and reject its ever-expanding mandate in immigration enforcement.** *Trump’s DHS has been deploying Border Patrol in complex immigration enforcement campaigns in cities far from any border, harassing communities and refusing to communicate with local law enforcement. Trump treats Greg Bovino, the “Commander At Large,” like his personal secret police chief.*


▶️ **Limit DHS’s reprogramming and transfer authority, including specifically preventing reprogramming and transferring funds for detention.** *This prohibits DHS from continuing to move money around to fuel ICE and Border Patrol lawlessness. We can’t trust that funds meant to be used for routine work like customs paperwork won’t be reallocated for dangerous detention centers or weapons of war used on our communities.*


▶️ **Deny the Trump regime’s demands for increased DHS funding.** *ICE alone already has a budget bigger than most countries’ militaries. No reforms, as necessary as they are, could justify funneling even more taxpayer dollars to Trump’s secret police and mass deportation machine.*

<h3>ICE Out For Good - Sherman Circle</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Sunday, February 1, 2026 at 2:00 PM CST - 3:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>3700 Georgia Ave NW<br>Washington, DC 20010</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Wednesday, January 7th, an American citizen was killed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Minneapolis, Minnesota. This killing is part of a broader pattern of unchecked violence, impunity, and abuse carried out by federal immigration enforcement agencies against members of our communities. 

A broad coalition of groups across the country is calling for a coordinated Ice Out For Good Weekend of Action on Saturday, January 10th and Sunday, January 11th to demand accountability, honor the life lost, and make visible the human cost of ICE’s actions. 

A core principle behind all ICE Out For Good events is a commitment to nonviolent action and no civil disobedience. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values, and to act lawfully at these events. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events. All events should be held in public spaces or on public property.

Indivisible is managing data and communications with participants. By registering, you agree to receive info from Indivisible about the event, receive communications via e-mail or SMS message from Indivisible, and receive any other updates and opportunities to take action or support ICE OUT FOR GOOD partner organizations. You also agree to have any data entered in this registration collected by Indivisible. Indivisible will treat your data according to our organization’s applicable privacy policy: https://indivisible.org/privacy-policy</p>

This week’s National message: ICE Out For Good! Dismantle ICE and impeach Noem!

Background
2025 ties with 2004 as the deadliest year for ICE since its founding in 2003, with 32 people dying in ICE custody both years. Since Trump&apos;s election, ICE has been escalating their attacks not just on our immigrant neighbors, but on citizens. Numerous American citizens have been ripped from their vehicles, pepper balled in the face, brutalized and taken into ICE custody, then released with no charges or trumped up charges like impeding a federal investigation or resisting arrest (which are frequently dropped in court).

For immigrants, the reality of ICE terrorism is bleaker. Hard working individuals are disappeared from their work, kidnapped at school drop off and pick up. The Trump regime has trampled on the sanctuary that schools and places of worship used to offer.  He has built concentration camps across the country with our tax dollars. Families are separated, loved ones are lost in a system designed to forget them. Prisoners in detention are subjected to deplorable living conditions; denied access to basic hygiene, medical care and legal representation. They are then deported to countries they have no ties to.

On January 7 and 8th, 2026 : ICE agent Jonathan Ross killed Renee Good, ICE agents tear gassed students at a high school in Minneapolis as they were abducting 4 school workers, and Customs and Border Patrol shot 2 people in Portland Oregon. The administration then turns around and lies to the public trying to convince the populace that we aren’t seeing what we see.

Many of us have called and written our congressional representatives to express our outrage at the escalation and blatant disregard for humanity shown by ICE agents. It is time to say ICE needs to get out of our communities for good.  

ACTION

Call or email your congressional leaders and demand the defunding and dismantling of ICE and impeachment of DHS Secretary Kristi Noem.

Script [adapted from 5calls.org]
Hi, my name is [NAME] and I’m a constituent from [CITY, ZIP].

        <name>ICE Out of SLO County! Show Up and Speak up at the Truth Act Forum</name>
        <description><![CDATA[
<h3>ICE Out of SLO County! Show Up and Speak up at the Truth Act Forum</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, January 27, 2026 at 3:00 PM CST - 8:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>SLO County Board Of Supervisors Chambers, Katcho Achadjian Government Center<br>1055 Monterey St<br>San Luis Obispo, CA 93408</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Come to the Truth Act Forum in the afternoon of the January 27 Board of Supervisors meeting to show up and speak out about our sheriff choosing to cooperate with ICE.  The board meeting starts at 9 am and the Truth Act Forum begins after lunch at 1 pm. Several days a week ICE agents abduct people being released from the SLO County jail, denying them due process. The sheriff says he is making our community safe by allowing ICE agents in the jail. How is it safe to allow masked agents armed to the teeth into the jail with families with children waiting to visit their loved ones? He is endangering his own unarmed correctional officers by allowing ICE agents to breach the secure area of the jail with stun guns drawn.  Show up and speak up to say ICE out of the SLO county jail!

Imagine you have a loved one brought into the jail the night before and you are waiting for their release in the jail lobby. Instead you see armed masked men standing in the lobby outside the release door. The door opens and your loved one is taken. Your children and you cry where are you taking them? They refuse to tell you. You go to your car to try and follow them and the Ice agents take pictures of you and your car. Your only choice is to go home and try to protect your children. How is this safe?


The TRUTH Act (AB 2792) provides vital know your rights information to our immigrant community members who are in Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) cross-hairs and bring some transparency to local law enforcement participation in federal immigration enforcement. The TRUTH Act requires a local legislative body to hold a community forum annually if local law enforcement allows ICE access to any individual. Additionally, this bill ensures that records related to ICE access are subject to the public records act.

On January 27 we need to show up speak out to make sure that the data presented at the Truth Act Forum provides transparency and accountability for all interactions with ICE by the the sheriff&apos;s office and at the jail. We need to make sure that the format allows for maximum public input. We deserve the truth!

You can speak during Public Comment period. You can speak on any item not on the agenda for 3 minutes. You fill out a slip requesting to speak. They are located in a box at the front of the room. You can also send in a written comment to the Board at boardofsups@co.slo.ca.us. please put Public comment not on the agenda in the subject line. You can also contact your Supervisor individually. You can also just show up to pack the chambers you can bring signs and wear orange to show solidarity. 

Here is a toolkit with everything you need to know about speaking up at the board meeting:

Contact Cambriaindivisible@gmail.com for more info.

If you don&apos;t want to speak out, your mere presence at the board meeting and support is great! You can hold signs. Let&apos;s fill the seats!

<p><strong>When:</strong> Sunday, February 1, 2026 at 2:00 PM CST - 4:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Roseville Galleria<br>Roseville Parkway &amp; Galleria Boulevard<br>Roseville, CA 95678</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Roseville CA</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>ICE agents are brutally beating and killing innocent people in the streets of Minneapolis and other American cities.  They are using escalating force, macing and tear gassing peaceful observers, detaining people including children, breaking into homes with no warrants and terrorizing entire communities.  Enough is enough!  When did America turn into a fascist state?  We will not normalize this violence and we refuse to stay silent!  

Our own Federal government has weaponized ICE against us and they are lying about what we see happening with our own eyes.  Bring your voice, signs, noisemakers, cowbells, whistles, music, etc. and join us as were rise up in protest!  We must not let this stand!  We demand accountability and justice for Nicole Good and Alex Pretti who were murdered in cold blood by cowardly ICE thugs.  

A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action and no civil disobedience. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values, and to act lawfully at these events. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events. All events should be held in public spaces or on public property.

<h3>VIGIL for VA Nurse - Alex Pretti - 48th St. Resistance - Light Brigade</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Wednesday, January 28, 2026 at 6:00 PM CST - 8:30 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>1739 48th St Sacramento, CA  95819 United States<br>1739 48th St Sacramento, CA  95819 United States<br>Sacramento, CA 95819</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Coalition Against Project 2025</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Join Nurses and community members in remembering Alex Pretti, a Minneapolis VA nurse murdered by ICE Saturday January 24th, while exercising his right to observe.   Say No to funding this abuse of authority.  Join our Vigil to Honor this lost life. Take Light rail Gold line to 48th street station or park in the neighborhood 

“Statement from the family of Alex Pretti, Michael and Susan Pretti:
We are heartbroken but also very angry.
Alex was a kindhearted soul who cared deeply for his family and friends and also the American veterans whom he cared for as an ICU nurse at the Minneapolis VA hospital. Alex wanted to make a difference in this world.
Unfortunately he will not be with us to see his impact. I do not throw around the hero term lightly. However his last thought and act was to protect a woman.
The sickening lies told about our son by the administration are reprehensible and disgusting. Alex is clearly not holding a gun when attacked by Trump&apos;s murdering and cowardly ICE thugs. He has his phone in his right hand and his empty left hand is raised above his head while trying to protect the woman ICE just pushed down all while being pepper sprayed.
Please get the truth out about our son. He was a good man. Thank you.”</p>

<h3>Planning meeting</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Sunday, February 1, 2026 at 12:00 PM CST - 2:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>St. Bartholomew Lutheran Church<br>1746 S Clinton Ave<br>Trenton, NJ 08610</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Happy New Year, Indivisibles!!! 
We started out 2026 with a sudden and fierce frost! But, we’re getting warmer! The Immigrant Trust Act is on Gov. Murphy’s desk as I write this! It isn’t perfect, but all the parts did pass!!  Our Pop-Up rally, ICE Out for Good was a success and with about 24 hrs to plan, 300 people came out to show their fabulous signs and resounding support for our community. 

At this meeting, we will re-group, discuss immediate and longer term plans. No Kings 3 will be in March (date: tbd).  Bring your ideas, bring your energy! 

We have been successful at coordinating with sister Indivisible groups, 50501, ICE Out of Princeton, Resistencia, St. Bart’s food ministries, etc.! We are stronger and more organized than ever! 

On the table for discussion: ICE prevention and response, elections, rallies and peaceful actions, and any ideas that you bring!

Look forward to seeing you there! 

This a local Indivisible event!

*A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*</p>

<h3>For Alex : ICE OUT FOR GOOD OAK PARK</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Sunday, February 1, 2026 at 2:00 PM CST - 4:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>35th Street &amp; Broadway<br>Sacramento, CA 95817</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Coalition Against Project 2025</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>ICE Out for Good — Oak Park Protest

Join us this Sunday, 12–2 PM, at 36th &amp; Broadway!

This is the moment.
This is the line in the sand.

Project 2025 is already giving ICE cover to act outside legal limits — escalating force, detaining people without cause, and terrorizing families in broad daylight. We refuse to normalize this. We refuse to stay silent. We show up to demand accountability, transparency, and safety for our communities.

Bring your voice.
Bring your signs.
Bring your courage.

See you at 36th &amp; Broadway — visible, loud, and united.</p>

<h3>ICE Out for Good Protest</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 7, 2026 at 5:00 PM CST - 6:30 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Gateway Plaza<br>790 W El Camino Real<br>Mountain View, CA 94040</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>We will peacefully gather to stand up to this MAGA regime of bullies for billionaires that is destroying lives and undermining our country. We will demand that ICE be defunded and dismantled as a secret, masked police force that terrorizes people—especially people of color—across the country.  

We will gather to speak the truth and demand accountability and justice for the ongoing pattern of ICE violence and abuse.

We will:  
- Call for ICE to leave our communities  
- Build public pressure  
- Create space for grief, solidarity, and collective action  

We will share Know Your Rights cards, information on how to report ICE activity, and educational leaflet on how ICE has become a building block of authoritarianism so you can spread the word.

Please join us and bring your friends and neighbors. We need to be in the streets, showing how crucial it is that we defend democracy.

WHISTLES - A COMMUNITY SAFETY UPDATE
We love everyone&apos;s enthusiasm with their various noise-makers but note that whistles are now used for ICE warnings. In order to avoid undue fear, confusion or panic for our communities, please refrain from using whistles hereafter for any protest events.  Bells and horns are alternatives. 

Fight back against the Trump Regime and the extremist budget cuts, kidnappings by masked goons, and attempted military take-over of our cities, cuts to Medicaid and Medicare. Due Process for all! People over profit! Billionaires should not rule America. ICE/Military out of our communities! Bring your own sign!

These are nonviolent events. Each of us is responsible for our own conduct. Stay within your rights, don’t break laws, stay safe, stay peaceful, and avoid any risk you don’t feel comfortable with. Don’t obstruct traffic, protest inside any business, impede people from entering or exiting any property, or commit any acts of property damage. Ignore any counter protestors and stay focused on peacefully delivering our message. If you need help or see something troubling, tell a uniformed police officer or call 911. If you can safely do so, record troublesome behavior with your phone, as this is often a strong deterrent to bad behavior.</p>

<h3>Ice Out For Good</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Friday, January 16, 2026 at 11:00 PM CST - 11:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> 50501 Norwich NY</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>https://act.indivisible.org/sign/ice-out-for-good/

This link sends your signatures automatically to your elected officials and you can even add your own comments at the end. 

Once you do this, take the time to search your senators&apos; and representatives contact information.  You can copy and paste the petition language, or use your own words to say it when you get to their contact page. 

Then call them - it&apos;s rare that anyone answers, but just give your name, that you are a constituent and you want them to defund ICE and why. If you state you want a reply, it means they must dedicate time to acknowledging your existence.  Do this every day. LOL. It&apos;s all about the traffic jam, which creates a work stoppage. Then they have to deal with it. 

This time around, both Ds and Rs need the &quot;encouragement&quot;. 

Want to take it to the next level - snail mail a postcard. They get thru security much faster, compared to envelopes.</p>

<h3>ICE Out Flathead County</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Monday, January 26, 2026 at 9:45 AM CST - 10:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Old County Courthouse, Flathead County Commissioners Meeting<br>800 S Main St<br>Kalispell, MT 59901</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Please read the description in full.

Wednesday, January 7th, an American citizen was killed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Minneapolis, Minnesota. This killing is part of a broader pattern of unchecked violence, impunity, and abuse carried out by federal immigration enforcement agencies against members of our communities.

It is also part of a larger strategy to blame our country&apos;s failed economic policies on the Latino immigrant scapegoat. This strategy not only is inhumane and wastes $11.3 billion of taxpayer funds on ICE, but distracts from the real problems: a government bought by oligarchs and policies that further widen the gap between the rich and the poor while exploiting our natural resources to the detriment of Mother Earth and ourselves.

A broad coalition of groups across the country is calling for coordinated Ice Out For Good actions to demand accountability, honor the lives lost, and make visible the human cost of ICE’s actions.

We are asking Flathead County community members to make public comment at the Flathead County Commissioner&apos;s public comment at 8:45am this Monday, January 27th on the third floor of the old county courthouse at 800 South Main.

We ask you to demand non-cooperation with ICE, DHS, and CBP. These federal agencies are rogue, are violating civil and human rights, and have no business being in our communities removing and abusing people whether they are citizens or not. Minneapolis has proven, what they can do to Latinos, they can do to any American regardless of citizenship status.

We demand, no cooperation with any ICE or CBP agency or agents: no data sharing, no phone calls, no support, no use of our local government facilities, building, or resources. We do not support DHS, ICE, or CBP. We do not support fascism. We do not support state-sanctioned terrorists in our community!

We held a similar public comment event for the recent city council meetings across the valley.  At Kalispell&apos;s, we were notified that the Sheriff&apos;s are cooperating with ICE, and Kalispell Police Department is required to support the Sheriffs.  The County Commissioners work with the Sheriff&apos;s Department, so we are going to bring our demands to them.

In a fun development the Commissioners are meeting with reps from Ryan Zinke afterwards.

See you Monday!</p>

<h3>Justice for Renée Good - ICE out of Home Depot Protest</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Sunday, February 1, 2026 at 1:00 PM CST - 3:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Bicentennial Way &amp; Mendocino Avenue<br>Santa Rosa, CA 95403</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Sonoma County</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>On Wednesday, January 7th, an American citizen, Renée Good, was killed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Minneapolis, Minnesota. This killing is part of a broader pattern of unchecked violence, impunity, and abuse carried out by federal immigration enforcement agencies against members of our communities.

On August 14, 2025, Roberto Carlos Montoya died during an I.C.E raid in Monrovia, California. He was struck by a car and killed while being pursued by I.C.E. Almost immediately, DHS released a dishonest press release denying responsibility for Roberto&apos;s death. This is the second documented death during an I.C.E. raid. There have been numerous protests at Home Depot locations across Southern California. Now in solidarity, protests will begin at Home Depot locations in Northern California.

A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.

Rain cancels and no event on holiday weekends.</p>

<h3>ICE OUT FOR GOOD - Lakeport CA</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, January 31, 2026 at 2:00 PM CST - 4:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Old Courthouse Museum Park<br>255 N Main St<br>Lakeport, CA 95453</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Lake County CA</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Join us on Saturday January 31 from NOON (til 2). at the Old Courthouse Museum park in Lakeport for an ICE OUT FOR GOOD protest rally.

The Trump regime is terrorizing our communities with brutal and often illegal immigration enforcement campaigns designed to test the limits of executive power and the nation’s willingness to stand up against this regime&apos;s power grab.  This pattern of unchecked violence and abuse by Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the Border Patrol, and other federal law enforcement agencies must end.

SPEAK OUT. Make your voice heard! This is important in light of the public ICE execution and murder of Alex Pretti and Renee Good in Minneapolis, and the multiple other deaths and injuries attributed to this agency.

Reminder: Do not engage with motorists and do not impede traffic either on the sidewalk or on the street.

Bring a sign. Make some noise.


A core principle behind all our events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values, and to act lawfully at these events. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events.

<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, January 31, 2026 at 2:00 PM CST - 4:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Sidewalk on NW Stewart Parkway (In Front of Stewart Parkway Medical Building)<br>2460 NW Stewart Pkwy<br>Roseburg, OR 97471</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p># 🛑 RALLY AGAINST THE REGIME

## A Weekly Saturday Protest Against Authoritarianism

**Hosted by:** Indivisible Douglas County

**Date:** Every Saturday (some exceptions for the holidays)

**Time:** 12:00 pm to 2:00 pm

**Location:** 2460 NW Stewart Pkwy, Roseburg, OR 97471 (the sidewalk in front of Stewart Parkway Medical Building, across the street from McDonald&apos;s and Big O Tires)

⸻

## ✊ WHY WE RALLY

This is a weekly, sustained protest against the accelerating rise of authoritarian rule, state violence, and systemic corruption under the Trump administration.

We are rallying to confront:

- The construction of an authoritarian state that uses fear, surveillance, and force to silence dissent

- The mass targeting, criminalization, and disappearance of immigrants and vulnerable citizens carried out by the Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)

- The normalization of corruption, abuse of power, and rule-by-decree governance

- The genocide that continues to this day in Gaza and the West Bank under the ongoing military campaign by Israel against the Palestinian people, aided by the United States

This rally is about one core truth:

- Human rights do not depend on citizenship.

- Human dignity does not stop at borders.

- Democracy cannot survive corruption and terror.

⸻

## 🎯 WHAT WE ARE DEMANDING

We are calling for:

- An end to ICE and DHS being used as political weapons to terrorize our immigrant communities

- The abolition of ICE activity in the United States

- Full protection of due process, asylum rights, and constitutional liberties for all people within our borders

- An end to authoritarian governance, political repression, and state intimidation

- An immediate end to U.S. complicity in Israel’s genocide against the Palestinian people

- Real accountability for corruption, war crimes, and abuse of power—at every level

⸻

## 👥 WHO THIS RALLY IS FOR

- Immigrants, refugees, and their allies

- The Palestinian people and supporters of Palestinian liberation

- Veterans, faith leaders, workers, students, parents, and elders

- Whistleblowers, organizers, human rights defenders

- Anyone who refuses to live under authoritarian rule or corruption by the Trump administration

- Anyone against authoritarianism, fascism, and the abuse of power

- You do not have to be an activist.

- You just have to care about human lives and democratic freedom.

⸻

## 🕊 SAFETY, DISCIPLINE &amp; NONVIOLENCE

This is a peaceful, nonviolent protest, and that means:

- Everyone is responsible for their own de-escalation, as a safety team may not be available for every protest

- Do not take the bait of those who wish to antagonize us or our movement, disengage or remove yourself from conflict

- No physical engagement with counter-protesters

- No weapons of any kind

⸻

ICE IS TERRORIZING OUR CITIES. An estimated 70,000 people have been detained and American citizens are being shot in the streets. 

Join us in solidarity with Minnesota, and our own Oregon communities to demand accountability, honor the lives lost, and make visible the human cost of ICE’s actions.

<h3>ICE Out for Good and Pretti.  National Training, Local Eastside Planning.</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Monday, January 26, 2026 at 7:00 PM CST - 9:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Covenant Presbyterian Church<br>18630 SE Division St<br>Gresham, OR 97030</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Outer East Portland Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>#### Tools we need, Actions to take to protect our rights and our community.

On Saturday, federal agents horrifically shot and killed 37-year-old Alex Pretti, an ICU nurse who cared for veterans, in the Eat Street neighborhood of south Minneapolis after brutally beating him in front of witnesses.  

We all have the right to document and record ICE - and it&apos;s more important than ever that we use it.

The first few weeks of 2026 have clearly shown us - the Trump regime has abandoned any pretense of honest governing. We&apos;re seeing escalating violence and lawlessness through ICE abductions and killings, international aggression, and open defiance of Congress, including the refusal to release the Epstein files.

#### Monday, 1/26 Is a National Training Day  with No Kings, Womens March, May Day Strong and other partners-  Its time to get stronger, more organized and build our resistance skills

* Non-Violent Direct Action
* Making Political Violence Backfire  
* Getting Corporate Accountability 

#### And we&apos;ll work together in small groups  to brainstorm and plan local actions focused on key corporations aiding and abetting the regime Target, Home Depot, Hilton
**And escalating pressure on the Senate to block DHS / ICE appropriations**

Sorry for the short notice - If you&apos;re not able to make Mon&apos;s meeting - see if someone in your group can come, and bring ideas and plans back to everyone.</p>

<h3>Call Sen Merkley - Vote NO! Demand Accountability &amp; Not One Penny More for ICE</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Monday, January 26, 2026 at 2:00 AM CST - 1:59 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Outer East Portland Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>*On Wednesday, January 7th, Renee Good, an American citizen, was shot and killed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Minneapolis, Minnesota. This killing is part of a broader pattern of unchecked violence, impunity, and abuse we&apos;re seeing in our own communities, carried out by federal immigration enforcement agencies against neighbors, co-workers, and friends.*

### Call Senator Merkley today. 
Join in the broad coalition of Americans across the country as we **call on Congress to get ICE Out For Good.** We can&apos;t wait around while ICE and DHS continue to harm more people. Congress MUST demand an **end to these reckless immigration raids, and  oppose any appropriations bill that includes increased funding for ICE or Border Patrol, and refuse to vote for any funding bill for DHS** 

### Congress must: 
- Strengthen restrictions on ICE and Border Patrol’s ability to conduct dragnet arrest operations and target people based on their race, language or accent, place of employment, or location at the time of the apprehension;
- End Border Patrol deployment to our cities and reject its ever-expanding mandate in immigration enforcement; and
- Limit DHS&apos;s reprogramming and transfer authority, including specifically preventing reprogramming and transferring funds for detention.


You can call every day - only once a day, though, to have your call counted.

#### Merkley DC office phone  (202) 224-3753
#### Portland office phone  (503) 326-3386
#### You may get a voicemail - Do leave a message 

**Here&apos;s a simplified message you can use as your call script**  
Hi, my name is [Your Name], and I’m a constituent from [Your City, State].

I’m calling to urge Senator Merkley to refuse to vote for any appropriations bill for the Department of Homeland Security that fails to rein in ICE.

Renee Good’s killing on January 7, is part of a broader pattern of unchecked violence, impunity, and abuse carried out by federal immigration enforcement agencies against our communities.

We can&apos;t wait around while ICE harms more people. Senator Wyden must push for an appropriations bill that puts serious restrictions on ICE, ends its dragnet raids, and doesn’t add a penny to its already bloated budget. 


##### If you&apos;re talking with a staffer, or if you&apos;d like - ask for a response. Make sure to leave your email too, to receive a response.

Do share this action with friends - maybe invite folks over for some coffee and calling.</p>

<h3>HANDS OFF GREENLAND 🇬🇱 ICE OUT OF OUR COMMUNITIES [Rally + Standout]</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, March 7, 2026 at 10:00 AM CST - 11:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Odell Veterans Memorial Park<br>56-98 Broadway<br>Beverly, MA 01915</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Swing Left</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Trump is waging war and committing murder to enrich his billionaire backers. We are fighting to stop him. Stand with us and take action this weekend to demand an end to the occupation of Greenland, Ukraine and our cities.

We’re focusing on corporate targets - companies set to benefit most from the occupation of ICE or Greenland.

We stand united demanding an end to the Greenland occupation and the removal of reckless untrained ICE agents from our communities. And we&apos;re taking our fight to the companies that are backing this administration and benefiting most.

Together we will hit these companies in their pocketbooks, force the administration to end the occupation of Greenland our cities and spread the word to our neighbors that we deserve better.

Every dollar spent in wars overseas or at home is a dollar we paid for with our taxes - a dollar that could and should go to helping our communities thrive. We can have good jobs, better schools, access to healthcare and get our basic needs met. But not while our government works for billionaires and not for us.

Join us, stand strong and speak up.

Please note: A core principle behind all our events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events</p>

<h3>Good Trouble Saturday - Get the ICE Out!</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, January 31, 2026 at 2:00 PM CST - 3:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>3500 E 4th Plain Blvd<br>Vancouver, WA 98661</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Greater Vancouver</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>✊ GOOD TROUBLE SATURDAYS ✊
Join Indivisible Greater Vancouver (IGV) and MoveOn–Clark County
We’re turning up the volume on justice every Saturday — standing together in solidarity with our neighbors and against the rising tide of ICE-fueled intimidation in our community.
Inspired by civil rights icon John Lewis, our weekly rallies are now Good Trouble Rallies — peaceful, non-violent actions rooted in love, courage, and the belief that we keep each other safe. We show up because our community deserves to live free from fear, harassment, and authoritarian overreach.
Location:
📍 E Fourth Plain Blvd &amp; Wilson Ave
On the south side of Evergreen Park and in the heart of Vancouver’s vibrant Latin community — and an area where we’ve seen an alarming increase in ICE presence and unjust detentions. We show up to say: Not on our watch.
🕓 Saturdays, 12–1 PM
🪧 Bring:
Your signs, your noisemakers, and your voice.
Some parking is available at Evergreen Park or in the surrounding neighborhood.
🗣️ Let’s send a clear message:
We protect each other. We stand with our immigrant neighbors. We reject authoritarianism in all forms.
Join us in making some Good Trouble — because our community deserves safety, dignity, and a government that works for the people, not one that terrorizes them.</p>

<h3>ICE Out for Good</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, January 31, 2026 at 11:00 AM CST - 1:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>134 Main St<br>Littleton, NH 03561</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> The NH Democratic Party</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>On January 24th ICE agents murdered another citizen. 

His name was Alex Pretti. He was a 37-year-old ICU nurse that worked at the Minneapolis VA Hospital. 

This is the third time this month that our criminal Administration has executed an American citizen.  

It’s time to show the Administration that The People have had enough of this lawlessness. 

On Saturday, Jan. 31st Northern Grafton County Democrats will be out in front of the Post Office and Social Security Office in Littleton from 12-2pm. I invite anyone that still believes in freedom, liberty, due process, and our Constitution to come and join me. 

We want the killings and kidnappings to stop, and we want ICE OUT of New Hampshire!</p>

<h3>ICE out for Good!  Civil Rights Sundays</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Sunday, February 1, 2026 at 2:00 PM CST - 3:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Market Square<br>Portsmouth, NH 03801</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Last week, over 1,200 people came out to protest the Murder of Renee Good, with ICE out for Good! and all that is going on! The fascist takeover of our country. The disregard for our Constitution and our laws.
The Murder of Renee Good, despite the attempts to obfuscate, boils down to the fact that nothing she did deserved a death sentence, and ICE was acting as Judge, Jury, and Executioner. Not just Jonothan Ross, but we have seen similar disregard for the law across the country.
Venezuela is still going on, as is the immigration crackdown, and now we have to worry about Iran and attacking our NATO partner, Greenland.
✔ Oppose U.S. war/militarism
✔ Reject regime change and sovereignty violations
✔ Call for peace and respect for international law
Join us at 3! Civil Rights Sundays!
Say No to the military being used against Citizens!
Due Process is being denied to immigrants; it is only a matter of time before it is taken from citizens!

Join us today to save our Democracy!

Build a Democracy that Money Can&apos;t Buy!
Stand up for Democracy!
Stand up for Our Country!
Stand up for Immigrants!
Stand up for History!
Stand up for Equity!
Stand up for Working People!
and on and on and on....
The Hand&apos;s Off and NO KINGS Rallies were awesome but we need to continue!
We stand along the street in front of the North Church, On Congress Street! the Brick Church off of Market Square in Portsmouth!
Everyone is welcome to bring their own signs, We also have signs, banners, and flags to share.
We call the event Civil Rights Sundays, we started in November of 2016 after Trump won the first time, and we were in the square every Sunday until Covid shut us down, then we went back out when Ukraine was invaded and brought back the name Civil Rights Sundays when Roe Vs Wade was overturned.
Please join us at 3 PM!
Call for a continued ceasefire in Gaza and for an end to our administration using our tax dollars to support a holocaust!

<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Bellevue Way Northeast &amp; Northeast 4th Street<br>Bellevue, WA 98004</p>

<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Exercise your free speech - while you still have it. Join Indivisible Eastside members in their ongoing protest of the harmful administration&apos;s policies every Saturday.

Hosted by Indivisible Eastside

On Wednesday, January 7th, an American citizen was killed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Minneapolis, Minnesota. This killing is part of a broader pattern of unchecked violence, impunity, and abuse carried out by federal immigration enforcement agencies against members of our communities.

We must stand up and send the strong message of ICE OUT FOR GOOD until ICE is out for good.

A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action and no civil disobedience. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values, and to act lawfully at these events. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events.

Join us for Tesla Takedown Tuesday and help send a clear message to Musk and Trump: We&apos;re not backing down. We&apos;re DOUBLING DOWN!

Our protests have helped force Musk from DC but our work is far from done. **Tesla&apos;s stock is UP because investors think we&apos;re going to fade away** while Musk buys our elections, spews hate and lies on his social network, and bullies even conservative members of Congress into giving Trump the power of a KING.

The stakes couldn’t be higher. No one is coming to save us. Not politicians, not the media, not the courts. **Our democracy has never faced someone with so much money and so little shame as Elon Musk.**

Please, join us. We need your voice. Let&apos;s make some noise!

See you Tuesday! 
PS. For our full schedule, check out DefundMusk.com.

Tesla Takedown is a peaceful protest movement. We oppose violence, vandalism and destruction of property. Please treat Tesla drivers with respect as they are most likely on our side!

<h3>Phone Bank for People&apos;s Champion Analilia Mejìa!</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Thursday, January 29, 2026 at 5:00 PM CST - 8:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Showing Up for Racial Justice</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>## Come phone bank with SURJ!  
We&apos;ll be calling to **elect people’s champion Analilia Mejìa** who is running to represent New Jersey&apos;s 11th Congressional District.

Come as you are!  No experience needed!  Full training &amp; *lots* of support included!

......................................

## Logistics:
- These phone banks are online on the Zoom platform. Log into the call on Zoom on your computer and bring your phone to make the calls (if you only have one device, still come!). 
- We have a robust training on the call to give you all the information you need-- a script, technical support, and coaching throughout.
- Returners can start early. 
- You will receive an email with orientation materials ahead of time.
- ***Please note the time zone for call time***. 

......................................

## Feeling Unsure?

- **Our model works** - learn from the best! Our phone banks have one of the highest rates of success in the country. No matter whether you&apos;re a brand new caller or a seasoned organizer, if you join our banks, you can trust that you are putting your effort into a method that works. And you&apos;ll get to learn powerful organizing skills from seasoned leaders! 
- Our conversations are based on **open-ended questions** and **deep listening.** **You do not need to be an expert** on the issues or a candidate - our phone banks are successful because we deeply connect with voters and make them feel heard.
- Want to hear what a phonebank is like? Check out [**this video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3w4tNKPTY8) interviewing SURJ phonebankers.

......................................

## Context:

We are living in a historic time of the consolidation of authoritarian, billionaire-funded power in this country. At the same time, at every turn, **regular people have risen up, fought back**, and set a vision for what working people deserve: affordable healthcare, good schools, the right to live in our communities without fear. Since Trump’s election, **SURJ has been a part of meeting this moment**, from training thousands of white people in strategic noncompliance to fight ICE raids to recruiting thousands of newly-activated people into our movement. 

As they defund the social safety net and peddle more racist lies, millions of people are increasingly feeling the effects of the billionaire agenda. We know this fight is on multiple fronts, and **in 2026 we have an opportunity to harness the energy of the streets** – to not only wrest power from MAGA, but to ***put candidates in office who are willing to stand up to Trump and fight for working class people.***

This race will affect thousands of working class people and help set the tone going into the **2026 midterms**. Alongside our partners across the country, this is the time for our movements to offer a bold vision and bring our people into it.

......................................

## About SURJ:
[Showing Up for Racial Justice](https://surj.org/) (SURJ) is the largest organization in the country that explicitly organizes white communities for justice. Instead of choosing racism, silence, or complicity, we help white communities choose  justice. We have thousands of national members and 150+ chapters across the US and Canada.</p>

JAN: Here Comes the Sun
By Bill McKibben 
Available on Amazon Paperback and Audible audio book 

The book explores the rapid, cheap growth of solar and wind power and how it offers humanity a genuine, hopeful chance to overcome the climate crisis and build a better civilization, despite fossil fuel industry opposition.

FEB:  A Future We Can Love 
By Susan Bauer-Wu 
Available on Amazon paperback + free audio book with Audible membership

Inspired by a conversation between the Dalai Lama and Greta Thunberg spoke for the first time in January 2021, millions of people around the world took notice. This book captures the lessons that came from that interaction. 


MAR: The Fragile Earth
By David Remnick, Henry Finder 
Available at local library, Hoopla and Amazon Paperback or Audible audio book

A collection of essays that tell the story of climate change—its past, present, and future—taking readers from Greenland to the Great Plains, and into both laboratories and rain forests.

APR: The Genius of Earth Day
By Adam Rome
Available at local library, Hoopla, Amazon + free audiobook with Audible membership.

The story of the first Earth Day is inspiring: it had a power, a freshness, and a seriousness of purpose that are difficult to imagine today. Earth Day 1970 created an entire green generation. 

MAY:  Amplify
By Adam Met 
Available on Amazon in paperback or Audible audio book

A musician and member of the multiplatinum band AJR, Adam Met is also a climate advocate and educator, who shows how to apply fan-building strategies to social movements in exciting, inventive ways. Amplify is a playbook for developing passionate supporters utilizing the art and science of engagement, collaboration, and authentic connection, with tactics that will inspire people to carry a climate message to the world and spur others to act.

JUN: Unsettled 
by Steven Koonin 
Available at the local library, on Hoopla and Amazon Paperback or Audible audio book

Koonin was the top science advisor to the Obama administration.  When it comes to climate change, the media, politicians, and other prominent voices have declared that “the science is settled.” In reality, the climate is changing, but the why and how aren’t as clear as you’ve probably been led to believe. Koonin takes listeners behind the headlines, dispels popular myths, and unveils little-known truths. 

JUL: Documentary:  Ice on Fire
Free on Youtube (1:37)
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP2IE8Upehc) 
Narrated by Leonardo DiCaprio

&quot;Ice on Fire&quot; explores the many ways we reduce carbon inputs to the atmosphere and, more importantly, how to &quot;draw&quot; carbon down, bringing CO2 out of the atmosphere and thus paving the way for global temperatures to go down. Through visiting visionaries and scientists young and old, the film explores the deep hope that we can turn away from the brink.  

AUG: Running Out 
By Lucas Bessire
Available at the local library, on Hoopla and Amazon Paperback

The imminent depletion of the Ogallala and other aquifers around the world is a defining planetary crisis of our times. Running Out explores aquifer depletion and the deeper layers through which it gains meaning and force. Anthropologist Lucas Bessire journeyed back to Western Kansas, where five generations of his family lived as irrigation farmers and ranchers, to try to make sense of this vital resource and its loss.

SEPT: Half Earth 
By Edward O. Wilson 
Available at the local library, on Hoopla and Amazon Paperback + Audiobook

In order to stave off the mass extinction of species, including our own, we must move swiftly to preserve the biodiversity of our planet. In this &quot;visionary blueprint for saving the planet&quot; (Stephen Greenblatt), Half-Earth argues that the situation facing us is too large to be solved piecemeal and proposes a solution commensurate with the magnitude of the problem: dedicate fully half the surface of the Earth to nature. 

OCT: The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind (watch the movie or read the book)
Movie: Find it on Youtube or Netflix 
Book: Available at the local library, on Hoopla and Amazon Paperback + Audiobook

Born to a family of farmers, Malawian agricultural engineer William Kamkwamba made headlines in 2001 when he built a functioning windmill out of old bicycle parts and scraps. (At the time, he was just 14 years old.) The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind, based on Kamkwamba’s memoir of the same name, tells the amazing true story of how he built a wind turbine and saved his small farming village from famine.

NOV: The Talking Earth (young adult)
by Jean George 
Available at the local library, on Hoopla and Amazon Paperback + Audiobook

Billie is a member of the Seminole Tribe, in a quest to identify facts over legend, she goes out into the Everglades alone, to stay until she can believe. In the wilderness, she discovers that she must listen to the land and animals in order to survive. With an otter, a panther cub, and a turtle as companions and guides, she begins to understand that the world of her people can give her the answers she seeks.
