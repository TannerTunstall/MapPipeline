        <name>National Day of Lobbying: Impeach, Convict, Remove, and Defund ICE [LEESBURG, VA] (VA-10)</name>
        <description><![CDATA[
<h3>National Day of Lobbying: Impeach, Convict, Remove, and Defund ICE [LEESBURG, VA] (VA-10)</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, February 17, 2026 at 3:00 PM UTC - 11:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Congressman Suhas Subramanyam Leesburg District Office<br>210 Wirt St SW<br>Leesburg, VA 20175</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> 50501Missouri</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>In the first week of 2026, the administration engaged in three flagrant abuses of power: (1) an unconstitutional military strike in Venezuela, (2) the extrajudicial murder of Renee Nicole Good by a member of the ICE paramilitary force for exercising her first amendment rights, and (3) the continued obstruction of justice for victims of Jeffrey Epstein’s child sex trafficking ring. A month into 2026, the administration has escalated their unchecked aggression against allies like Greenland and countries like Cuba, Columbia, and Mexico. ICE has kidnapped preschoolers and used them as bait for their parents, and the administration is considering deploying military police to back them up.

In short: It’s not getting better and Congress is not meeting the moment. 

Democracy does not defend itself; it requires the active participation of the people. While countless Americans have already called, emailed, written letters, signed petitions, and while activist organizations have brought groups to Capitol Hill calling for impeachment, this moment demands something more visible, more direct, and more powerful: constituents showing up at congressional district offices, where staff rarely, if ever, engage with constituents.

Impeachment is not optional. It is the remedy mandated by the Constitution. Likewise, Congress holds the power to de-fund and abolish ICE. They aren’t acting because they do not have the political will to do so. So we will lend them some of ours.

WHO/WHEN:

FLARE USA, Citizens&apos; Impeachment, and 50501 Movement are proud to announce the next National Day of Action: in-district lobbying on February 17, 2026 for the impeachment of President Trump and the complete abolishment of ICE. Representatives will be in their districts; it&apos;s time to catch them at home. It&apos;s time to Remove the Regime AND abolish ICE!

Grassroots pro-democracy organizations (e.g., local chapters of Indivisible, Hands Off, 50501), progressive primary candidates, and other concerned citizens will join together in leading constituents into the local/in-district offices of all 435 US House Representatives to demand impeachment and the abolishment of ICE. 

Please see our attendee guide for more information on why we&apos;re mobilizing, specific goals, current news on impeachment, and a full guide, including scripts, for visiting and following up with your Representative&apos;s office at tinyurl.com/lobby217guide. 

By registering for the event, you are agreeing that event partners may receive your contact information and communicate with you about related activities. 

All participants are committed to lawful, non-violent action and no civil disobedience.</p>

<h3>ICE Out For Good [RESTON, VA 20191]</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Thursday, February 12, 2026 at 8:00 PM UTC - 9:00 PM</p>

Please join Defend Democracy Indivisible (NOVA) with your Signs, or Help us with our letters to spell out our Demand -- ICE OUT FOR GOOD.  We will encounter residents of Reston as well as the Commuters who work here and live elsewhere.  We want to remind the commuters (in particular Gov. Contractors with connections to DHS) on their way home, that the People by a large majority think ICE has gone to far.  We need to remind people  of the life lost, the chaos rendered, the cruelty explosion, and the total disdain for the rule of law by ICE and the ICE masters.

A core principle behind all ICE Out For Good events is a commitment to nonviolent action and no civil disobedience. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values, and to act lawfully at these events. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events. All events should be held in public spaces or on public property.

<h3>Fight for Democracy - Out with ICE  [Tysons VA]</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 14, 2026 at 4:00 PM UTC - 5:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Westpark Dr and Route 7<br>Gosnell Rd<br>Tysons, VA 22102</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Third Act and Indivisible are grassroots groups in all 50 states that believe in the possibility of change and are doing the work to make it happen.  We believe that we, the people, through our members, and along with many other organizations, and with millions of residents, can turn around the current march towards autocracy. BUT ONLY WITH YOUR HELP.

Here in Northern Virginia, we are not staying silent in the face of the attack on every institution and every racial, ethnic, and religious group in this country except those of the elites (you know who we mean).   When everything is under attack, what do we do?  Stand up and fight back.  Stand up and fight back against hatred, bigotry, racism, xenophobia, homophobia, misogyny, and antisemitism.   Stand up and fight back against the attacks on NIH, CDC, EPA, NPS, DOE, DOJ, CFPB, SSA, USAID, the Fed, universities, and law firms.  Stand up and fight back against the federal invasion of our cities and the kidnapping of hard-working, tax paying, loyal immigrants looking for a better way of life. Out with ICE!   And we do not forget about our felllow citizens of the world - the continuing and unending genocide in Gaza supported by US arms,  the unprovoked atrocities in Ukraine not defended by US arms, and the mind-numbing degree of starvation and disease in Africa caused by the cruel policy to take away the US AID humanitarian  mission.

Our Putin-loving president is in the process of taking away all of our constitutional rights and trying to take away our humanity.  STAND UP AGAINST IT ALL.  Come out with signs, banners, horns, whistles, pots and pans - whatever you can think of to get the attention of your fellow citizens who are passing by and may not be as focused as they should be on the desperate state of our democracy.  

Stand up for the Constitution for the Rule of Law.  Stand up for Humanity.

This is not the time to sit on the sidelines. This is a time for action!

This a local Indivisible event!

<h3>Joyful Bridge Brigade Springfield VA</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 14, 2026 at 4:15 PM UTC - 5:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Pedestrian Bridge over Springfield Masonic Temple<br>7001 Backlick Rd<br>Springfield, VA 22150</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Joyful Bridge Brigade</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>******  The rally for Tuesday, February 10, and the rally for Wednesday, February 11 are cancelled! The overpass is still unsafe due to dangerous patches of ice, and freezing temperatures predicted.****



The JOYFUL BRIDGE BRIGADE is a friendly group of like-minded souls protesting the current regime and its heartless and un-American policies. We give voice to our concerns and express our displeasure through messaging posted on the overpass, all-the-while building community and solidarity. Come join us, make new friends and stand up for a better future.

As the current situation shows no signs of abating, we will continue our protests on a weekly basis on Tuesdays, Saturdays and a special one hour &apos;lighted protest rally&quot; on Wednesdays.

There are two signup slots for each event:            
1. To help with setup          
2. To attend the actual rally

The pedestrian walkover bridge is located across from the Springfield Masonic Temple on Backlick Rd, which is next to the Fairfax County Fire Department Engine Co. 22.  The walkup ramp is right next to the Springfield Franconia Parkway Exit/Entrance Ramp. (on map, just above the map  label for the Masonic Lodge). Parking at Beverly Lane, just south of the Parkway ramps on Backlick. Put Beverly Lane, with no street number, into your GPS and it will take you right to the area on Beverly Lane where you can park on the street. (Google Maps page below)

There is a decent amount of traffic on Watkins Mill we&apos;d love to appeal to also.

Convenient street parking close-by in neighborhood to the west of I-270 on Parkview Ave.

<h3>ICE Out For Good - Germantown</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 14, 2026 at 4:00 PM UTC - 6:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>On 355, near Applebees<br>Maryland 355 &amp; Henderson Corner Road<br>Germantown, MD 20876</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Wednesday, January 7th, an American citizen Renee Nicole Good was killed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Then on January 24th another US citizen, Alex Pretti was killed by Customs and Border Patrol in Minneapolis. These killings are part of a broader pattern of unchecked violence, impunity, and abuse carried out by federal immigration enforcement agencies against members of our communities, in clouding YS citizens, legal permanent residents, visa holders, asylum seekers, and undocumented immigrants. 

A broad coalition of groups across the country is calling for a coordinated Ice Out For Good campaign to demand accountability, honor the life lost, and make visible the human cost of ICE’s actions. We are also calling for organized boycotts of companies that support this violence and authoritarianism.

A core principle behind all ICE Out For Good events is a commitment to nonviolent action and no civil disobedience. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values, and to act lawfully at these events. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events. All events should be held in public spaces or on public property.

By registering, you agree to receive info from Indivisible about the event, receive communications via e-mail or SMS message from Indivisible, and receive any other updates and opportunities to take action or support ICE OUT FOR GOOD partner organizations.

        <name>National Day of Lobbying: Impeach, Convict, Remove, and Defund ICE - Rockville, MD (MD-08)</name>
        <description><![CDATA[
<h3>National Day of Lobbying: Impeach, Convict, Remove, and Defund ICE - Rockville, MD (MD-08)</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, February 17, 2026 at 4:00 PM UTC - 7:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Rep. Raskin&apos;s In-District Office on Monroe<br>51 Monroe St ste 503<br>Rockville, MD 20850</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> 50501Missouri</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>In the first week of 2026, the administration engaged in three flagrant abuses of power: (1) an unconstitutional military strike in Venezuela, (2) the extrajudicial murder of Renee Nicole Good by a member of the ICE paramilitary force for exercising her first amendment rights, and (3) the continued obstruction of justice for victims of Jeffrey Epstein’s child sex trafficking ring. A month into 2026, the administration has escalated their unchecked aggression against allies like Greenland and countries like Cuba, Columbia, and Mexico. ICE has kidnapped preschoolers and used them as bait for their parents, and the administration is considering deploying military police to back them up.

In short: It’s not getting better and Congress is not meeting the moment. 

Democracy does not defend itself; it requires the active participation of the people. While countless Americans have already called, emailed, written letters, signed petitions, and while activist organizations have brought groups to Capitol Hill calling for impeachment, this moment demands something more visible, more direct, and more powerful: constituents showing up at congressional district offices, where staff rarely, if ever, engage with constituents.

Impeachment is not optional. It is the remedy mandated by the Constitution. Likewise, Congress holds the power to de-fund and abolish ICE. They aren’t acting because they do not have the political will to do so. So we will lend them some of ours.

WHO/WHEN:

FLARE USA, Citizens&apos; Impeachment, and 50501 Movement are proud to announce the next National Day of Action: in-district lobbying on February 17, 2026 for the impeachment of President Trump and the complete abolishment of ICE. Representatives will be in their districts; it&apos;s time to catch them at home. It&apos;s time to Remove the Regime AND abolish ICE!

Grassroots pro-democracy organizations (e.g., local chapters of Indivisible, Hands Off, 50501), progressive primary candidates, and other concerned citizens will join together in leading constituents into the local/in-district offices of all 435 US House Representatives to demand impeachment and the abolishment of ICE. 

Please see our attendee guide for more information on why we&apos;re mobilizing, specific goals, current news on impeachment, and a full guide, including scripts, for visiting and following up with your Representative&apos;s office at tinyurl.com/lobby217guide. 

By registering for the event, you are agreeing that event partners may receive your contact information and communicate with you about related activities. 

All participants are committed to lawful, non-violent action and no civil disobedience.</p>

<h3>Olney Stands Up for Democracy</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Thursday, February 12, 2026 at 10:00 PM UTC - 11:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Georgia Avenue &amp; Maryland 108<br>Olney, MD 20832</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>We stand with our neighbors for democracy, for justice, and for an economy that works for all of us, not just billionaires. We stand for science, the rule of law, a working government, kindness and common decency.

We stand on the streets so people who are fearful know they are not alone. We protest to remind ourselves that this is not normal. This is not what generations of Americans have fought and died for; we stand in the streets to honor their legacy.

We oppose fascism, tyranny, the lawless cruelty of ICE, the epic corruption, the reckless attacks on science, the idiotic tariffs, and we call out the spineless elected officials who are bending their knees to a clown who thinks only of himself.

Our protests give courage to everyone else who takes a stand. We won&apos;t back down to a clown. And when that clown goes down, we will mourn all that we have lost, and then we will rebuild on a firmer foundation. Together.

Come for your own reasons, bring your own signs or borrow one. Bring your own light or borrow one. Bring your own sounds, or dance to the protest playlist we have.

It&apos;s going to be dark and cold at 5:00, so dress warmly and maybe bring a booklight to illuminate your protest sign. To keep us all safe, we will cancel if the temperatures are below freezing, or when it rains, sleets, or snows. This is a marathon.

<h3>Indivisible Bowie &amp; Beyond 5Calls Storm Team weekly call to legislators</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Wednesday, February 18, 2026 at 5:00 AM UTC - 4:30 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>## Messaging Storm 2.11.2026

### Wednesday, February 11, 2026

All Day Action: A coordinated call to our Elected Officials

U.S. Capitol Switchboard: (202) 224-3121

or visit [5calls.org](5calls.org) and input your address to get direct phone numbers to your elected officials.

**This week’s National message:**

Weaponization of personal data for Government Surveillance.

**Background:**

Administrative warrants and surveillance techniques by the government are not new. Since 9/11, however, Congress has given broad powers to federal agencies, including DHS, and this has included an expansion of the use of administrative subpoenas to circumvent time consuming investigative processes (Ali, 2026; Cox, 2026). These subpoenas allow government agencies to acquire personal information without the consent or knowledge of the individual (ACLU, 2026; Cox, 2026). It is not required by law for companies to report subpoena data, but some choose to do so; Google reported a 15% increase in subpoenas for user data in the first 6 months of Trump’s 2nd term (Cox, 2026). These subpoenas are being used not just for immigration raids either, they are targeting individuals exercising their first amendment rights. Jon “Doe” of Pennsylvania received such a subpoena after he emailed a DHS immigration attorney to attempt to enter a plea on behalf of an asylum seeker from Afghanistan; a few hours later he had a notice from Google that DHS had requested information associated with his Google account (ACLU, 2026; Cox, 2026). “Doe” and the ACLU are currently fighting these subpoenas.

This is important information to understand as activists, and we should be outraged by ALL the ways DHS and the DOJ are accumulating personal data on protestors, activists, legal observers, and our immigrant neighbors through:

- Racial Profiling

- AI Facial Surveillance

- License plate readers tracking car movement,

- ICE and CBP agents taken photographs of protestor faces for their data bases

- Sending letters of disapproval to government officials

 These are all average people engaging in their constitutional rights and embracing our democratic process. The government overreach of the Department of Homeland Security as well as other Federal agencies like the FBI and CIA, hearkens back to the McCarthy era. We must take a stand and rein in Federal overreach.

**Action:** Demand Congress investigate DHS and other federal agencies&apos; use of administrative subpoenas and technology to track and target citizens and residents in the US.

**Wednesday Call Script:**

Hi, my name is **[NAME]** and I’m a constituent from **[CITY, ZIP]**. (Leave full address if leaving a voicemail).

I&apos;m calling **[REP/SEN NAME]** to express my outrage over the Department of Homeland Security’s use of administrative warrants and other invasive data practices to gather information on American citizens exercising their First Amendment Rights. DHS agents have stated they are developing a protestor database using surveillance data from license plate trackers, AI facial recognition technology and even concerned citizens contacting government officials. I am disgusted by this weaponization of personal data to come after regular citizens and residents, as well as its use to deter people from exercising their personal freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. This overreach by federal law enforcement agencies mut be investigated.

ICE has kidnapped preschoolers and used them as bait for their parents, and the administration is considering deploying military police to back them up.

In short: It’s not getting better and Congress is not meeting the moment. 

Democracy does not defend itself; it requires the active participation of the people. While countless Americans have already called, emailed, written letters, signed petitions, and while activist organizations have brought groups to Capitol Hill calling for impeachment, this moment demands something more visible, more direct, and more powerful: constituents showing up at congressional district offices, where staff rarely, if ever, engage with constituents.

Impeachment is not optional. It is the remedy mandated by the Constitution. Likewise, Congress holds the power to de-fund and abolish ICE. They aren’t acting because they do not have the political will to do so. So we will lend them some of ours.

WHO/WHEN:

FLARE USA, Citizens&apos; Impeachment, and 50501 Movement are proud to announce the next National Day of Action: in-district lobbying on February 17, 2026 for the impeachment of President Trump and the complete abolishment of ICE. Representatives will be in their districts; it&apos;s time to catch them at home. It&apos;s time to Remove the Regime AND abolish ICE!

Grassroots pro-democracy organizations (e.g., local chapters of Indivisible, Hands Off, 50501), progressive primary candidates, and other concerned citizens will join together in leading constituents into the local/in-district offices of all 435 US House Representatives to demand impeachment and the abolishment of ICE. 

Please see our attendee guide for more information on why we&apos;re mobilizing, specific goals, current news on impeachment, and a full guide, including scripts, for visiting and following up with your Representative&apos;s office at tinyurl.com/lobby217guide. 

By registering for the event, you are agreeing that event partners may receive your contact information and communicate with you about related activities. 

All participants are committed to lawful, non-violent action and no civil disobedience.</p>

<h3>Know Your Right Canvass 2.0, Glen Burnie</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Wednesday, February 25, 2026 at 4:15 PM UTC - 7:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>East Moon Asian Bistro<br>7400 Governor Ritchie Hwy suite A<br>Glen Burnie, MD 21061</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Glen Burnie</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Our second Glen Burnie canvass will reach out to businesses with information about the rights of individuals and employers when dealing with ICE. As the events of December 24th showed, ICE is getting more active in Anne Arundel County. It&apos;s vital that people know their rights and how to prepare for interactions with ICE and other immigration agencies.

If you haven&apos;t done a KYR canvass before, no worries! We&apos;ll have a brief training before going out, and we will work in teams. These canvasses get very positive responses from the community overall. In the few cases where people are not open to our message, we simply move on!

We will meet at a Glen Burnie restaurant- the location will be provided when you sign up.  The restaurant staff has asked that we arrive at 11:15 so they have time to set up.  Hope to see you there!

*A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*</p>

<h3>Calling All Resistance Knitters/Crocheters - Melt the Ice Hat Knit-In</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Sunday, February 15, 2026 at 7:00 PM UTC - 9:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>The Shops at Kenilworth<br>800 Kenilworth Dr<br>Towson, MD 21204</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Allies for Democracy</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>In the 1940s, Norwegians quietly defied Nazi occupation by knitting and wearing red, pointed hats with tassels. A simple garment became an act of protest. Today, Minnesota knitters are reviving that tradition—and they need more hats.

Join us as we knit and crochet *Melt the Ice Hats*. These red hats will be sent to **Needle &amp; Skein** yarn shop in Minnesota and distributed to protesters.

🧶 **Next Melt the Ice Hat Knit-In**  
📅 **When:** Sundays, February 15 - March 8, 2026
⏰ **Time:** 2–4 pm  
📍 **Where:** The Shops at Kenilworth Mall – Common Area  

**How:** Bring red yarn and needles or a hook if you have them. Knit and crochet patterns may be found on Ravelry. Beginners welcome, and supplies may be available to share.</p>

<h3>Organizing Volunteers for No Kings 3 and Presentation by the co-Founder of Hagamos Vaca</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Sunday, February 15, 2026 at 7:00 PM UTC - 9:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>James City County Recreation Center<br>5301 Longhill Rd<br>Williamsburg, VA 23188</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Williamsburg JCC Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Please join us on Sunday, February 15th at 2pm at the James City County Recreation Center, located at 5301 Longhill Road, for a meeting concerning upcoming Indivisible actions, including No Kings 3 and a special presentation concerning the non-profit Hagamos Vaca.

We are extremely fortunate to have Jonathan Westmoreland, an ESL and Spanish teacher in a local public school, speak with us about the 501(c)(3) nonprofit he co-founded, Hagamos Vaca, which is rooted in this community. &quot;In Spanish, &quot;hagamos vaca&quot; means &quot;let’s chip in.&quot; It’s what you say when the problem is bigger than one person can fix, but together, we’ve got it covered. That’s exactly what we’re doing—pooling our money, time, and whatever else it takes to make sure immigrant families in New Kent, King William, James City County, Hampton Roads, and other communities have a roof over their heads, food in the fridge, and a community that has their backs.&quot;

We will also be organizing volunteers for No Kings 3, Saturday March 28th at 2pm at the Williamsburg James City Courthouse. We had over 6,000 people at our No Kings 2 and expect a much bigger crowd with everything occurring in our Country. Volunteer positions will include marshals, setup, sign-ins, greeters, first aid, bringing supplies, such as coolers with water/ice, etc... Please participate in some way to help facilitate a great event. Thank you!</p>

<h3>Freedom Fridays: ENOUGH!!!</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Friday, February 13, 2026 at 5:00 PM UTC - 6:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Williamsburg James City County Courthouse<br>5201 Monticello Ave<br>Williamsburg, VA 23188</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Williamsburg JCC Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>All our events are weather dependent. If it is icy outside, we will cancel.

ENOUGH!!! - That says it all. Please join us at NOON on Friday, February 13, 2026, at the Williamsburg James City County Courthouse, located at 5201 Monticello Avenue, Williamsburg, with the sign that expresses what you have had enough of from the Trump Administration and MAGA. Dress warmly and bring a beverage and a chair, if necessary.

COMMUNITY NORMS

Please read before attending one of our events.

One of our main objectives is to host PEACEFUL, RESPECTFUL and SAFE EVENTS.

Remember, when attending a Williamsburg JCC Indivisible event, your actions represent our group, and you are expected to conform to the Community Norms. Safety is a top priority for our attendees. Please remain out of the median, per instructions from the police. Being in the median puts us at risk and potentially drivers as well. 

If an Urgent Situation arises, we will raise a straight arm with our Hand in a Fist to ask for Silence. PLEASE DO THE SAME TO QUIET THE CROWD. This way we can quickly relay an important message to all. 

We wish to remind everyone that we do not react to those drivers who make it clear they do not support us by aggravating them through screaming obscenities or making certain hand gestures. We do not want to enrage them and potentially make everyone, including other drivers, less safe. It is easier to wave at everyone and say, “Have a nice day.”

PLEASE DO NOT BLOW WHISTLES UNLESS ICE IS PRESENT. The purpose of the whistles is to alert the public to be vigilant. Otherwise, blowing them can falsely alert the crowd to a danger that does not exist!

At our events, please do not hold signs or otherwise promote other events that Williamsburg JCC Indivisible is not hosting. You may be placing a potential legal liability onto our group that we are NOT willing to accept.

Please do not engage in DISRUPTIVE BEHAVIOURS!

If you are asked to stop engaging in activities which are disrupting an event to the point people are complaining to the hosts that they are experiencing physical or emotional trauma, it is expected that you will be respectful of others and follow our Community Norms and stop those behaviours. Loud noises, such as, but not limited to, cowbells, horns, etc., are usually deployed by counter-protesters to disrupt an event, not by attendees participating in an event. If you refuse to disengage from such thoughtless behaviours, do not ruin the event for everyone else - please be kind and leave!

As with our previous events, the same rules apply. We will not engage with counter-protesters. If an issue arises, please notify one of the event organizers, who will be wearing Williamsburg JCC Indivisible T-shirt. We will not engage in any acts of violence or violation of any applicable laws or engage in civil disobedience. All actions will be peaceful. Everyone participating in this event will be required to behave lawfully to ensure the safety of event participants and will seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values. We will obey the orders of authorized event marshals and law enforcement authorities. Event organizers will not be responsible for any injury or damage if any were to occur during this event. 

Each individual is responsible for the consequences of their actions and attends at their own risk.

We will park in the Courthouse parking lot without blocking access lanes and will remove any trash that is left. We are committed to maintaining public health measures to practice safe protesting during these times. Please wear a mask and socially distance if that makes you more comfortable - weigh your own risk in attending. Follow all local safety guidelines at minimum, and any safety instructions from hosts that exceed local law.</p>

<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Walnut Street &amp; 3rd Street<br>Harrisburg, PA 17120</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Join us to demonstrate for impeachment, conviction and removal of Trump and his minions, AND for cutting funding for ICE (at the expense of health care and other humane causes). At The People&apos;s Corner (Third and Walnut) we will call out the unlawful, corrupt, and inhumane policies of Trump and his Secretaries Hegseth, Bondi, and Noem, and urge our Legislators to DO THEIR JOB and remove these incompetent appointees.

The People’s Corner is in close proximity to both Fetterman’s and McCormick’s offices, and also the Commonwealth Partners office who do propaganda work for Scott Perry, so bring your signs (or use the ones we’ll provide!) to let them know that the regime has go to GO!

<h3>Focused Accountability Campaign</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Thursday, February 12, 2026 at 11:30 PM UTC - 1:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Lancaster Together</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Hope in Action Lancaster is focusing on local public officials one by one, holding them accountable for complicity with the Trump regime, or for their passivity in the face of this onslaught.

We intend to start with the Lancaster County Sheriff, who signed a 287g contract with ICE. We are looking to have folks contact the sheriff&apos;s office regularly with questions and offering their opinion in a sustained, coordinated way. We plan to use phone calls, emails, letters, and letters to the editor.

After this campaign we intend to turn our sights on other local elected officials who are culpable in the current trend towards authoritarianism. Join us for our sessions.

This meeting is every 2nd and 4th Thursday evenings of the month. It is a collaboration with Solidarity Lancaster and Indivisible Lancaster Together, but all are welcome.

**All Indivisible events are nonviolent and participants are encouraged to de-escalate any conflicts.**</p>

<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Lancaster Together</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Know Your Rights Training

The whole world is watching Minneapolis and many of us are asking: what do we do if ICE comes to our community? Join us to hear from Matt Johnson about your Constitutional rights during ICE enforcement and how to keep our whole community safe.

Unchecked and unlawful actions by federal DHS employees remind us that citizens need to know their rights in order to speak out with confidence. Attend this training with one of our local experts so you can understand better what you can do, and be in a position to share that information with others. 

Let&apos;s all take care of ourselves and each other!</p>

<h3>ICE Out of Home Depot/ICE Out for Good!</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Sunday, March 1, 2026 at 7:00 PM UTC - 8:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Red Rose Commons<br>1700 Fruitville Pike<br>Lancaster, PA 17601</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> National Day Laborer Organizing Network</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Home Depot depends on the labor of immigrant workers, from construction to disaster recovery, profiting from global markets while turning its back on vulnerable communities here at home. This injustice cannot continue. Together, we have the power to demand accountability and justice.

Join us as we make it impossible for Home Depot to ignore the voices of the people. We stand united, sending a clear message that our communities deserve protection, respect, and solidarity—not neglect.

Here in Lancaster we have been hosting a series of sustained events to continue the pressure on the Home Depot corporation and the wider Lancaster County community. We gather along Fruitville Pike with our signs and our presence demonstrating our support for our immigrant neighbors. We encourage the Home Depot to publicly condemn the ICE raids taking place on or near their properties. We urge our community to condemn the cruel and illegal actions of ICE throughout this country. We come together to be an example for corporations and our local community to ACT, to SPEAK UP, and to take a STAND!</p>

<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>4345 Kirkwood Hwy<br>Wilmington, DE 19808</p>

Join Indivisible Newark DE and Indivisible Highlands and Beyond for a protest against Citizens Bank.

When banks fund ICE detention, they are not neutral — they are complicit. Citizens Bank is a major lender to companies that build and operate ICE detention centers, profiting from a system that cages and abuses immigrants. We are coming together to demand accountability and to make it clear: our communities will not accept banks fueling ICE abuse.

## Event Logistics

- ⭐ Rain or Shine • No March • Peaceful Protest⭐ 
- 🚫 No weapons, drugs or alcohol, please!
- ❄️ We will WEATHER the Trump administration!  Bundle up! The temperatures are expected to be cold.
- 🦺 We have a team of volunteers to help ensure the event runs smoothly and safely.
- 🔲 Homemade signs are best.  If you are able, please make a sign to amplify the protest theme.

## Sign Ideas

<h3>Blacksburg Post Office Protest</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Friday, February 13, 2026 at 10:00 PM UTC - 11:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Blacksburg Post Office<br>118 N Main St<br>Blacksburg, VA 24060</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>The post office is at 118 North Main St. across from the UPS store.
    We will gather starting at 4:50pm.  If participants can’t be there by 5:00pm that’s ok - they should just join in once they can.  By 5:00pm there’s lots of slow-moving traffic to see us.

    The message of the protest (i.e., what signs are needed) is to oppose abuses against our democracy by the Trump regime, and most especially the ongoing abuses by ICE, such as along the lines of our recent #ICEoutforGood actions.
  
    We will be most effective by keeping our attack (signs and other messages) on the regime itself and not on ordinary Trump supporters or people who partly sympathize with them.  We ultimately need to win over some of these people to be successful against the regime.

    NRVI requires protest participants to abide by nonviolent principles and actions, and for protest signs and other messages to be consistent with our commitment to nonviolence.  No weapons or items that could be mistaken as weapons are allowed.

    Town requirements we will need to follow:
        Use the outer (street-side) part of the sidewalk, maintaining a clear path for pedestrians in the other half of the sidewalk and making way for people crossing the street, getting off a bus, etc.  (And of course staying out of the street itself.)

        Participants should park in public parking spaces if they are driving there. There is nearby public parking along Draper Road (parallel to Main Street and one block downhill from it) and some connecting streets.  If it’s difficult to find parking there, you should be able to park in the Kent Square parking garage (payable by credit card), on Draper between Washington and Lee Streets.  On-street parking is normally free starting at 5:00pm, and takes change or credit cards until then.

*A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*</p>

        <name>National Day of Lobbying: Impeach, Convict, Remove, and Defund ICE - West Chester, PA (PA-06)</name>
        <description><![CDATA[
<h3>National Day of Lobbying: Impeach, Convict, Remove, and Defund ICE - West Chester, PA (PA-06)</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, February 17, 2026 at 4:00 PM UTC - 5:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Rep Houlahan&apos;s West Chester Office<br>709 E Gay St suite 4<br>West Chester, PA 19380</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> 50501Missouri</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>In the first week of 2026, the administration engaged in three flagrant abuses of power: (1) an unconstitutional military strike in Venezuela, (2) the extrajudicial murder of Renee Nicole Good by a member of the ICE paramilitary force for exercising her first amendment rights, and (3) the continued obstruction of justice for victims of Jeffrey Epstein’s child sex trafficking ring. A month into 2026, the administration has escalated their unchecked aggression against allies like Greenland and countries like Cuba, Columbia, and Mexico. ICE has kidnapped preschoolers and used them as bait for their parents, and the administration is considering deploying military police to back them up.

In short: It’s not getting better and Congress is not meeting the moment. 

Democracy does not defend itself; it requires the active participation of the people. While countless Americans have already called, emailed, written letters, signed petitions, and while activist organizations have brought groups to Capitol Hill calling for impeachment, this moment demands something more visible, more direct, and more powerful: constituents showing up at congressional district offices, where staff rarely, if ever, engage with constituents.

Impeachment is not optional. It is the remedy mandated by the Constitution. Likewise, Congress holds the power to de-fund and abolish ICE. They aren’t acting because they do not have the political will to do so. So we will lend them some of ours.

WHO/WHEN:

FLARE USA, Citizens&apos; Impeachment, and 50501 Movement are proud to announce the next National Day of Action: in-district lobbying on February 17, 2026 for the impeachment of President Trump and the complete abolishment of ICE. Representatives will be in their districts; it&apos;s time to catch them at home. It&apos;s time to Remove the Regime AND abolish ICE!

Grassroots pro-democracy organizations (e.g., local chapters of Indivisible, Hands Off, 50501), progressive primary candidates, and other concerned citizens will join together in leading constituents into the local/in-district offices of all 435 US House Representatives to demand impeachment and the abolishment of ICE. 

Please see our attendee guide for more information on why we&apos;re mobilizing, specific goals, current news on impeachment, and a full guide, including scripts, for visiting and following up with your Representative&apos;s office at tinyurl.com/lobby217guide. 

By registering for the event, you are agreeing that event partners may receive your contact information and communicate with you about related activities. 

All participants are committed to lawful, non-violent action and no civil disobedience.</p>

<h3>Melting ICE: Inside the Movement to Protect Sussex County</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Monday, February 23, 2026 at 10:00 PM UTC - 11:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Lewes Public Library<br>111 Adams Ave<br>Lewes, DE 19958</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Women&apos;s March Sussex</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Join Women&apos;s March Sussex in-person in Lewes or online as representatives  from the Delaware Coalition for Immigrant Justice share what that organization is doing to support immigrant communities in Sussex County, and how friends and allies can help. Co-presented by Margaret Reyes and Joanne McAfee.

Reyes is a fierce advocate for the Hispanic and immigrant rights communities for two decades. Her experience includes serving as the Social Justice Chair of the Governor’s Advisory Council on Hispanic Affairs, and holding the immigration chair for the Delaware Domestic Violence Coordinating Council, as well as her participation with the Delaware Coalition for Immigrant Justice. Margaret is a retired firefighter and FEMA urban search and rescue task force member with multiple deployments, who has lived primarily in Delaware since 2000. She holds dual citizenship with the United States and Ireland.  

A native Delawarean, McAfee lives near Milford with her husband, Carlos, and their two adult children. After studying Immigration Law at Villanova University, she began working as an immigrant advocate and immigration specialist. For the past five years, she has advocated for reformed immigration policies at both the local and national levels and has co-facilitated discussion groups focused on racial healing and honoring lived experience. She also works closely with Margaret and the Delaware Coalition for Immigrant Justice in Sussex County to spread awareness and support and protect neighbors impacted by ICE operations.

The Delaware Coalition for Immigrant Justice shares information regarding federal immigration enforcement and supports members of the immigrant community adversely affected by these actions. 

Women’s March Sussex – Delaware, an Indivisible group since 2024, is an intersectional and inclusive coalition, promoting active participation in the political process on the local, state, and national levels. Its mission is to empower Sussex County residents through education and civic engagement, equipping them to advocate for issues affecting women. By fostering informed participation, we strive to create a more just, equitable, and sustainable future for women in Sussex County and across Delaware.

Due to limited seating, registration is required.

<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Veterans Memorial Park<br>Race Track Rd<br>Ocean Pines, MD 21811</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Indivisible Worcester MD is extending our ICE OUT FOR GOOD demonstrations to every Saturday at 2 pm in Ocean Pines. 70 people came out on Jan 11 and 75 attended on Jan 17. We&apos;re on a roll; let&apos;s keep the momentum going!

This will be announced with other Indivisible events on mobilize.us, via email to the Indivisible Worcester mailing list (if you are not receiving email notices from us, go to http://tinyurl.com/indivisibleworcestermd to sign
up), through the Democratic Women&apos;s Club of Worcester County, and to the Indivisible Worcester Facebook group. If we need to cancel for bad weather, it will be through the above outlets.

We have a limited number of signs to share on ICE and other anti-Trump topics. If you can, please bring your own.

Parking--There is a small lot near the Veterans Memorial  that you can reach through the back of the Sports Core Pool lot.  You can also park at the public library across Cathell Rd.

A core principle behind all ICE Out For Good events is a commitment to nonviolent action and no civil disobedience. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values, and to act lawfully at these events. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events. All events should be held in public spaces or on public property.</p>

        <name>National Day of Lobbying for Impeachment and the Abolishment of ICE - Virginia Beach, VA (VA-02)</name>
        <description><![CDATA[
<h3>National Day of Lobbying for Impeachment and the Abolishment of ICE - Virginia Beach, VA (VA-02)</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, February 17, 2026 at 3:00 PM UTC - 11:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Main Street &amp; Town Center Drive<br>Virginia Beach, VA 23462</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> 50501Missouri</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>In the first week of 2026, the administration engaged in three flagrant abuses of power: (1) an unconstitutional military strike in Venezuela, (2) the extrajudicial murder of Renee Nicole Good by a member of the ICE paramilitary force for exercising her first amendment rights, and (3) the continued obstruction of justice for victims of Jeffrey Epstein’s child sex trafficking ring. A month into 2026, the administration has escalated their unchecked aggression against allies like Greenland and countries like Cuba, Columbia, and Mexico. ICE has kidnapped preschoolers and used them as bait for their parents, and the administration is considering deploying military police to back them up.

In short: It’s not getting better and Congress is not meeting the moment. 

Democracy does not defend itself; it requires the active participation of the people. While countless Americans have already called, emailed, written letters, signed petitions, and while activist organizations have brought groups to Capitol Hill calling for impeachment, this moment demands something more visible, more direct, and more powerful: constituents showing up at congressional district offices, where staff rarely, if ever, engage with constituents.

Impeachment is not optional. It is the remedy mandated by the Constitution. Likewise, Congress holds the power to de-fund and abolish ICE. They aren’t acting because they do not have the political will to do so. So we will lend them some of ours.

FLARE USA, Citizens&apos; Impeachment, and 50501 Movement are proud to announce the next National Day of Action: in-district lobbying on February 17, 2026 for the impeachment of President Trump and the complete abolishment of ICE. Representatives will be in their districts; it&apos;s time to catch them at home. It&apos;s time to Remove the Regime AND abolish ICE!

WHO/WHEN/WHERE: Visit Rep. Jen Kiggans&apos; Virginia Beach Town Center Office (Virginia&apos;s 2nd District) on Tuesday, Feb. 17. The address is 283 Constitution Drive, Suite 900, but the One Columbus building is actually located at the corner of Main St. and Town Center Dr. The Office is open from 9 am to 5 pm.  First, try making an appointment by calling 757-364-7650 or using their meeting request form at https://kiggans.house.gov/meeting-request. If you are unable to make an appointment, then just show up and make a written statement. Afterwards, attend the Protest Rally in front of her building from 3-5:30 pm. This local action is supported by Virginia Beach Resistance, Freedom Virginia, and COVA Coalition. 

Grassroots pro-democracy organizations (including the three mentioned above and other local chapters of Indivisible, Hands Off, and 50501), progressive primary candidates, and concerned citizens are joining together to lead constituents to the local/in-district offices of all 435 U.S. House Representatives to demand impeachment and the abolition of ICE. 

Please see the attendee guide for more information on why we&apos;re all mobilizing, specific goals, current news on impeachment, and a full guide for visiting and following up with your Representative&apos;s office at www.tinyurl.com/lobby217guide. 

A recommended script is also available at https://citizensimpeachment.com/february-17th-day-of-action-with-flare/. 

By registering for the event, you consent to event partners receiving your contact information and communicating with you about related activities. 

All participants are committed to lawful, non-violent action and no civil disobedience.</p>

<h3>Citizens Bank: Stop Funding Cruelty Limerick</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, March 7, 2026 at 4:00 PM UTC - 5:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Citizens Bank<br>429 W Ridge Pike<br>Limerick, PA 19468</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Montgomery County PA &amp; Friends</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>📅 Join us Saturday, March 7th, at 11 AM as we come together across Pennsylvania to send a message to Citizens Bank and raise awareness in our communities about Citizen’s role in supporting for-profit detention operators.

Citizens Financial Group, through subsidiaries like Citizens Bank, has long financed private prison and detention operators despite decades of allegations of abuse, neglect, forced labor, and fraud. Companies like CoreCivic and GEO Group have caused widespread harm — including wrongful deaths, medical neglect, and exploitation.

Right here in Pennsylvania, GEO operates the Moshannon Valley Processing Center, the largest ICE detention facility in the Northeast, just three hours from Montgomery County. Join us-- and others statewide-- to tell Citizens Bank that we want them to stop supporting cruelty.

We would like to hold actions at more branch locations based on interest.</p>

<h3>National Day of Lobbying: Impeach, Convict, Remove, and Defund ICE [REPLACE CITY YOUR EVEN IS IN]</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, February 17, 2026 at 11:00 PM UTC - 1:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Washington County Democratic Headquarters<br>225 Putnam St<br>Marietta, OH 45750</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> 50501Missouri</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Since our representatives are more than 2 hours away, we will be lobbying at our local democratic headquarters.  Bring a snack and a drink and comradery. 


In the first week of 2026, the administration engaged in three flagrant abuses of power: (1) an unconstitutional military strike in Venezuela, (2) the extrajudicial murder of Renee Nicole Good by a member of the ICE paramilitary force for exercising her first amendment rights, and (3) the continued obstruction of justice for victims of Jeffrey Epstein’s child sex trafficking ring. A month into 2026, the administration has escalated their unchecked aggression against allies like Greenland and countries like Cuba, Columbia, and Mexico. ICE has kidnapped preschoolers and used them as bait for their parents, and the administration is considering deploying military police to back them up.

In short: It’s not getting better and Congress is not meeting the moment. 

Democracy does not defend itself; it requires the active participation of the people. While countless Americans have already called, emailed, written letters, signed petitions, and while activist organizations have brought groups to Capitol Hill calling for impeachment, this moment demands something more visible, more direct, and more powerful: constituents showing up at congressional district offices, where staff rarely, if ever, engage with constituents.

Impeachment is not optional. It is the remedy mandated by the Constitution. Likewise, Congress holds the power to de-fund and abolish ICE. They aren’t acting because they do not have the political will to do so. So we will lend them some of ours.

WHO/WHEN:

FLARE USA, Citizens&apos; Impeachment, and 50501 Movement are proud to announce the next National Day of Action: in-district lobbying on February 17, 2026 for the impeachment of President Trump and the complete abolishment of ICE. Representatives will be in their districts; it&apos;s time to catch them at home. It&apos;s time to Remove the Regime AND abolish ICE!

Grassroots pro-democracy organizations (e.g., local chapters of Indivisible, Hands Off, 50501), progressive primary candidates, and other concerned citizens will join together in leading constituents into the local/in-district offices of all 435 US House Representatives to demand impeachment and the abolishment of ICE.

<h3>Citizens vs. Citizens Bank--Stop Funding ICE Detention Centers!</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 21, 2026 at 4:00 PM UTC - 5:30 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>2030 NJ-70<br>Cherry Hill Township, NJ 08002</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Cooper River Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Citizens Bank is a major lender to Geo Group and Core Civic, both of whom run private prisons and detention facilities like Delany Hall in Newark, Elizabeth Detention in Elizabeth NJ, and Moshannon in Pennsylvania.  

After ICE abducts our friends and neighbors, Delaney Hall, Elizabeth Detention Center and Moshannon are where most of them are taken. There, they are subject to abuses such inhumane living conditions, severe medical neglect, abusive treatment from guards, poor food/water quality and more all while these corporations make record profits off of the suffering of human beings.  

This must stop.  

Join us in peacefully protesting their complicity.  Bring signs specific to this action so we can spread the word!

For example: 
--De-ICE Citizens Bank
--Cages aren&apos;t Communities 
--Stop Financing Ice Prisons
--Citizen Bank-Cut Ties with ICE Prisons
 

Bring your signs and spread the word!



PS.  When parking, let’s spread out in the lots behind Citizen’s Bank.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
<h3>March SURJ members General Meeting in the Eno River Area!</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Sunday, March 8, 2026 at 5:00 PM UTC - 7:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br><br>Durham, NC 27704</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Showing Up for Racial Justice</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>We&apos;ll be continuing our work of **Block &amp; Build**: defending our communities from harm while building the power we need to win long-term change. We do this by focusing on two concrete areas: Strengthening and participating in [**Siembra’s organizing**](https://www.siembranc.org/) to resist government overreach and ICE raids while also moving people to action in [**SURJ’s national campaigns**](https://surj.org/current-campaigns/).


✨ **SAVE THE DATE** ✨
**Sunday, March 8th
1:00–3:00pm** (+ social time afterwards!)
Location will be downtown Durham. Make sure to **RSVP** so we can confirm the location with you!

**What we WILL be doing**: 
We’ll share updates on ongoing SURJ members’ work in the Eno River area and talk about specific projects to plug into. This includes some specific workstreams from our brainstorming in the last General Meeting, a proposal to organize MN Solidarity Parties or potlucks with our friends and neighbors, and ways to plug into ongoing work nationally and locally

**Who SHOULD attend**
Are you interested in building deeper, long-term relationships with other white people who want to fight for racial and economic justice by building power together in our community?

You don’t need prior training, organizing experience, or deep familiarity with the work. This meeting is for people who are ready to move toward action and shared responsibility—not just learning about the work. If that sounds like you, we’d love to have you.

*Introduction to SURJ: Showing Up for Racial Justice (SURJ) is a national organization that organizes white people to fight for racial and economic justice. For too long, the Right has used racism to divide us and protect the wealth and power of billionaires. Locally, we are SURJ volunteers in the Eno river area who work to turn concern into action by bringing people together to resist harm in our communities and build the skills, commitments, and collective power needed for lasting change.*</p>

<h3>Citizens Bank: Stop Funding Cruelty Willow Grove</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, March 7, 2026 at 4:00 PM UTC - 5:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Montgomery County<br>3905 Welsh Rd<br>Willow Grove, PA 19090</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Montgomery County PA &amp; Friends</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>📅 Join us Saturday, March 7th, at 11 AM as we come together across Pennsylvania to send a message to Citizens Bank and raise awareness in our communities about Citizen’s role in supporting for-profit detention operators.

Citizens Financial Group, through subsidiaries like Citizens Bank, has long financed private prison and detention operators despite decades of allegations of abuse, neglect, forced labor, and fraud. Companies like CoreCivic and GEO Group have caused widespread harm — including wrongful deaths, medical neglect, and exploitation.

Right here in Pennsylvania, GEO operates the Moshannon Valley Processing Center, the largest ICE detention facility in the Northeast, just three hours from Montgomery County. Join us-- and others statewide-- to tell Citizens Bank that we want them to stop supporting cruelty.

We would like to hold actions at more branch locations based on interest.</p>

<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Workers, customers, and communities deserve safety, dignity, and transparency everywhere in America. When corporations enable attacks on our civil rights instead of supporting the people in their community, we need to let them know that we demand better from them in a peaceful way.

Let&apos;s use our BUYING POWER to send a message to Target to Stand Up to ICE in MN and across the U.S. We ask them to enact and enforce business policies that protect against unlawful search &amp; seizure and unlawful detainment according to 4th Amendment rights held by both citizens &amp; businesses. 

Our PEACEFUL PRESENCE &amp; VISIBILITY draws attention of the management of corporations and of our fellow community members! Similar actions were taken with ice scrapers last month in LA.


### This action is being co-hosted by ACTION TOGETHER BURLINGTON COUNTY &amp; SJ NOW INDIVISIBLE.</p>

<h3>ONE PEOPLE&apos;s No Kings 3 United Pushback</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, March 28, 2026 at 4:00 PM UTC - 6:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Summit Square Shopping Ctr<br>1717 Langhorne Newtown Rd<br>Langhorne, PA 19047</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> ONE PEOPLE</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Last year, in thousands of towns and cities across the country, millions poured into the streets for the largest single-day protest in US history. 

On March 28 we&apos;ll take to the streets again, ready to bring millions of new allies along with us to declare, in one voice: NO thugs terrorizing our neighborhoods. NO troop deployments in our streets. NO imperial wars of conquest. NO KINGS.

Trump clearly wishes to rule like a king. But -- as every community targeted by ICE and CBP has shown -- we the people refuse to cower in the face of his cruelty. This country doesn&apos;t bow down to tyrants. We sure as hell won&apos;t bow down to the kinds of wretched ghouls who kidnap children, teargas schools, and murder our neighbors then slander them as domestic terrorists.

This regime’s ongoing brutality and authoritarianism have only convinced more Americans, including many who’ve never attended a protest in their lives, to join their neighbors in the streets. Now we&apos;ve got to keep that momentum growing, with the same creativity and dogged determination.

Everything we&apos;ve done so far is the stuff of history. And together, we&apos;ll write the history of how, for the second time in 250 years, we the people defied, and overcame, a tyrant.

Once again ONE PEOPLE will do our part to fight against an Autocratic President and to Safeguard Our Democracy!</p>

This will be a nonviolent demonstration. We are here to say ICE is not welcome. We are standing up for what we believe in. We want to inspire people to join us and grow our movement!

Please bring signs; no swastikas please.

We are excited to see you there and stand together for our country and let ICE know they are not welcome!

See you every Friday morning engaging drivers in Cary.

<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Crossroads Center<br>1117 E Stuart Dr<br>Galax, VA 24333</p>

Wednesday, January 7th, American citizen Renée Nicole Macklin Good was killed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Minneapolis, Minnesota and then ICE killed Alex Pretti January 24. At least six more people have been killed while in ICE custody since the beginning of 2026. These killings are part of a broader pattern of unchecked violence, impunity, and abuse carried out by federal immigration enforcement agencies against members of our communities.

We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values, and to act lawfully at these events.

        <name>Raleigh, NC - National Day of Lobbying: Impeach, Convict, Remove, &amp; Defund ICE - Raleigh, NC (NC-02)</name>
        <description><![CDATA[
<h3>Raleigh, NC - National Day of Lobbying: Impeach, Convict, Remove, &amp; Defund ICE - Raleigh, NC (NC-02)</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, February 17, 2026 at 5:30 PM UTC - 6:30 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Deborah Ross&apos;s Office<br>300 Fayetteville St<br>Raleigh, NC 27601</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> 50501Missouri</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>In the first week of 2026, the administration engaged in three flagrant abuses of power: (1) an unconstitutional military strike in Venezuela, (2) the extrajudicial murder of Renee Nicole Good by a member of the ICE paramilitary force for exercising her first amendment rights, and (3) the continued obstruction of justice for victims of Jeffrey Epstein’s child sex trafficking ring. A month into 2026, the administration has escalated their unchecked aggression against allies like Greenland and countries like Cuba, Columbia, and Mexico. ICE has kidnapped preschoolers and used them as bait for their parents, and the administration is considering deploying military police to back them up.

In short: It’s not getting better, and Congress is not meeting the moment. 

Democracy does not defend itself; it requires the active participation of the people. While countless Americans have already called, emailed, written letters, signed petitions, and while activist organizations have brought groups to Capitol Hill calling for impeachment, this moment demands something more visible, more direct, and more powerful: constituents showing up at congressional district offices, where staff rarely, if ever, engage with constituents.

Impeachment is not optional. It is the remedy mandated by the Constitution. Likewise, Congress holds the power to defund and abolish ICE. They aren’t acting because they do not have the political will to do so. So we will lend them some of ours.

WHO/WHEN:

FLARE USA, Citizens&apos; Impeachment, and 50501 Movement are proud to announce the next National Day of Action: in-district lobbying on February 17, 2026, for the impeachment of President Trump and the complete abolishment of ICE. Representatives will be in their districts; it&apos;s time to catch them at home. It&apos;s time to Remove the Regime AND abolish ICE!

Grassroots pro-democracy organizations (e.g., local chapters of Indivisible, Hands Off, 50501), progressive primary candidates, and other concerned citizens will join together in leading constituents into the local/in-district offices of all 435 US House Representatives to demand impeachment and the abolishment of ICE. 

Please see our attendee guide for more information on why we&apos;re mobilizing, specific goals, current news on impeachment, and a full guide, including scripts, for visiting and following up with your Representative&apos;s office at tinyurl.com/lobby217guide. 

By registering for the event, you are agreeing that event partners may receive your contact information and communicate with you about related activities. 

All participants are committed to lawful, non-violent action and no civil disobedience.</p>

ICE OUT FOR GOOD

Wednesday, January 7th, an American citizen was killed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

<h3>Day of Action for Immigration Protection</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Thursday, February 12, 2026 at 2:30 PM UTC - 7:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>New Jersey Statehouse<br>125 W State Street<br>Trenton, NJ 08625</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> AAPI New Jersey</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Day of Action for Immigrant Protections Rally and Activist Teach-In

As the nation witnesses ICE and DHS’s increasing cruelty, New Jersey advocates and activists are heading to the New Jersey’s State capitol to demand lawmakers pass the full immigration protections that the former Governor pocket vetoed and left on the table for Governor Sherrill.  

The remaining bills include the most significant protections including Privacy protection bill which limits data sharing, and the Immigrant Trust Directive codification - that would limit local law enforcement from collaborating with ICE. 

Demand our lawmakers protect every New Jerseyan’s due process rights to the full extent of the law. 

Join AAPI New Jersey as we stand with immigrants and organizations from around the state to demand full immigrant protections now!</p>

<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Law Enforcement Detention Center<br>201 N Church St<br>Winston-Salem, NC 27101</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Camel City United Indivisible North Carolina</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>On the final day of early voting, we are coming together for a county-wide action to make our voices heard.

First, we vote.
Then, at 4:00 PM, we exercise our First Amendment right to assemble.

We will gather at the Forsyth County Jail to make a clear public statement:

We want ICE out of our communities.

We do not want local law enforcement accusing, detaining, or cooperating with ICE beyond what the law requires.

Our communities deserve safety, dignity, and accountability — not fear.

This action is about visibility, presence, and people power.

We are calling people neighborhood by neighborhood —
from apartment communities to cul-de-sacs,
from churches to block groups —
to show up together and fill the space.

This is not about disruption.
It is about public accountability.
It is about being seen and counted.

Voting is how we use our ballots.
Assembling is how we use our voices.

Vote by 3.
Assemble at 4.</p>

<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, February 17, 2026 at 3:00 PM UTC - 4:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Rep. Knott&apos;s Office<br>12450 Cleveland Rd 203<br>Garner, NC 27529</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> 50501Missouri</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>In the first week of 2026, the administration engaged in three flagrant abuses of power: (1) an unconstitutional military strike in Venezuela, (2) the extrajudicial murder of Renee Nicole Good by a member of the ICE paramilitary force for exercising her first amendment rights, and (3) the continued obstruction of justice for victims of Jeffrey Epstein’s child sex trafficking ring. A month into 2026, the administration has escalated their unchecked aggression against allies like Greenland and countries like Cuba, Columbia, and Mexico. ICE has kidnapped preschoolers and used them as bait for their parents, and the administration is considering deploying military police to back them up.

In short: It’s not getting better and Congress is not meeting the moment. 

Democracy does not defend itself; it requires the active participation of the people. While countless Americans have already called, emailed, written letters, signed petitions, and while activist organizations have brought groups to Capitol Hill calling for impeachment, this moment demands something more visible, more direct, and more powerful: constituents showing up at congressional district offices, where staff rarely, if ever, engage with constituents.

Impeachment is not optional. It is the remedy mandated by the Constitution. Likewise, Congress holds the power to de-fund and abolish ICE. They aren’t acting because they do not have the political will to do so. So we will lend them some of ours.

WHO/WHEN:

FLARE USA, Citizens&apos; Impeachment, and 50501 Movement are proud to announce the next National Day of Action: in-district lobbying on February 17, 2026 for the impeachment of President Trump and the complete abolishment of ICE. Representatives will be in their districts; it&apos;s time to catch them at home. It&apos;s time to Remove the Regime AND abolish ICE!

Grassroots pro-democracy organizations (e.g., local chapters of Indivisible, Hands Off, 50501), progressive primary candidates, and other concerned citizens will join together in leading constituents into the local/in-district offices of all 435 US House Representatives to demand impeachment and the abolishment of ICE. 

Please see our attendee guide for more information on why we&apos;re mobilizing, specific goals, current news on impeachment, and a full guide, including scripts, for visiting and following up with your Representative&apos;s office at tinyurl.com/lobby217guide. 

By registering for the event, you are agreeing that event partners may receive your contact information and communicate with you about related activities. 

All participants are committed to lawful, non-violent action and no civil disobedience.</p>

<h3>Roxbury, NJ Says No to ICE Detention</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Wednesday, February 18, 2026 at 12:30 AM UTC - 1:30 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Roxbury Township Town Hall<br>1715 US-46<br>Roxbury Township, NJ 07852</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Bogota Community Defense</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Join a community call to action to stop an ICE detention facility from being built in Roxbury, NJ. Show up to the city council meeting to make it clear that all of New Jersey opposes the so called &quot;Amazon warehouse for humans&quot;, and that Roxbury rejects having the detention in their backyard.

Attendees will have the option to use a three-minute public comment slot to speak directly to the council, or you can simply stand with neighbors to demonstrate unified opposition to this project. Your presence matters and visible turnout influences decisions. If you&apos;re planning to speak, please be respectful but assertive. Don&apos;t insult, don&apos;t let the rage out all the way, but let them see that it makes you angry, let them see how this is making you feel. Show them that this is wrong. Together, we are united!</p>

        <name>National Day of Lobbying: Impeach, Convict, Remove, and Defund ICE - Akron, OH (OH-13)</name>
        <description><![CDATA[
<h3>National Day of Lobbying: Impeach, Convict, Remove, and Defund ICE - Akron, OH (OH-13)</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, February 17, 2026 at 3:00 PM UTC - 5:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Main Place-Emilia Sykes Office<br>121 S Main St suite 107<br>Akron, OH 44308</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> 50501Missouri</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>In the first week of 2026, the administration engaged in three flagrant abuses of power: (1) an unconstitutional military strike in Venezuela, (2) the extrajudicial murder of Renee Nicole Good by a member of the ICE paramilitary force for exercising her first amendment rights, and (3) the continued obstruction of justice for victims of Jeffrey Epstein’s child sex trafficking ring. A month into 2026, the administration has escalated their unchecked aggression against allies like Greenland and countries like Cuba, Columbia, and Mexico. ICE has kidnapped preschoolers and used them as bait for their parents, and the administration is considering deploying military police to back them up.

In short: It’s not getting better and Congress is not meeting the moment. 

Democracy does not defend itself; it requires the active participation of the people. While countless Americans have already called, emailed, written letters, signed petitions, and while activist organizations have brought groups to Capitol Hill calling for impeachment, this moment demands something more visible, more direct, and more powerful: constituents showing up at congressional district offices, where staff rarely, if ever, engage with constituents.

Impeachment is not optional. It is the remedy mandated by the Constitution. Likewise, Congress holds the power to de-fund and abolish ICE. They aren’t acting because they do not have the political will to do so. So we will lend them some of ours.

WHO/WHEN:

FLARE USA, Citizens&apos; Impeachment, and 50501 Movement are proud to announce the next National Day of Action: in-district lobbying on February 17, 2026 for the impeachment of President Trump and the complete abolishment of ICE.

<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>This a local Indivisible event!

(These rallies were previously titled &quot;Musk or Us&quot;. Now we&apos;re showing up to highlight all our reasons to be outraged at the Trump administration.)

Under Trump and GOP leadership-

*millions have lost healthcare
*taxes are rising 
*everyday costs are soaring
*our streets are being militarized
*people are being disappeared
*pedophiles are shielded from accountability. 

Now, ICE is shooting people in the streets.

Trump’s administration is in full-blown power grab mode—shredding laws, defying court orders, and handing control of the country’s financial system to billionaire cronies.

We must apply relentless, all-out pressure to stop this coup in its tracks!

Bring your signs and raise your voice to highlight the issues you care most about.

Note-for your safety, please stay on the sidewalk. 📍 Where: [Tesla Dealership, Route 35, Eatontown, NJ] , 11:00 am-12:00 pm]

Sign up now and bring a friend!

<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>1715 NJ-35<br>Middletown Township, NJ 07748</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Protest Rally! 

Join Indivisible, Jersey Shore Blue, Middletown Outrage into Action, Shore Area NOW, and MOCA, as we protest against a slew of concerns, including ICE’s illegal detention of immigrants without due process, ICE’s escalation of violence in Minneapolis, the cuts to Medicaid and other essential federal programs, the tax cuts to billionaires, the illegal invasion of Venezuela, and Trump’s threats to Greenland and other countries. Until Rep. Chris Smith and the rest of Congress begins to show genuine congressional oversight and push back against the unconstitutional actions of the Trump administration, we will protest.

Join us Wednesday from 3:30 to dusk in front of Rep. Chris Smith&apos;s Middletown office located at 1715 Route 35! While Chris Smith has abandoned this office, we have not. His office building is just north of the Middletown Post Office on 35. Look for us roadside on the grass in front of the office building&apos;s parking lot. Remember to bring your signs, your flags, and your friends!!

<h3>Crucial Conversations: Let&apos;s Keep Talking</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Monday, February 23, 2026 at 10:30 PM UTC - 1:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Unitarian Universalist Church<br>3300 Morewood Rd<br>Fairlawn, OH 44333</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Akron</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>* What: Community Conversation Focus Group (feat. **food** and beverages)
* When: Monday, Feb. 23 at 5:30 pm 
* Where: Unitarian Universalist Church of Akron

If you attended our Sept. 8, 2025, event, &quot;[Discomfort Is the Door to Freedom](https://indivisibleakron.substack.com/i/172480281/join-us-monday-sept-8-for-an-important-discussion-and-food),&quot; with the Freedom Bloc and Indivisible Akron, and you&apos;re wondering, &quot;what&apos;s next&quot;... This is what&apos;s next!

Using the MLK Community Conversation framework, facilitators will guide participants through a grounding welcome, a brief icebreaker, and small‑ or full‑group dialogue. We’ll focus on themes such as **mental health, community safety, and economic stability** — areas Dr. King spoke about with honesty and urgency, and which continue to influence daily life in our communities.

Together, we’ll establish shared conversation agreements that support respect, openness, and confidentiality. Participants will practice active listening, share personal experiences, and consider how community patterns, assumptions, and resources shape our sense of connection and possibility. The goal is not debate, but understanding—meeting one another where we are and imagining what becomes possible when we prioritize care and belonging.

We’ll close with a collective reflection, inviting insights, takeaways, and ideas for strengthening our community moving forward. Whether you’re new to these conversations or returning, your voice and presence matter. This event is an opportunity to slow down, listen deeply, and help build a more connected, compassionate Akron.

* 5:30 p.m. doors open and food is served
* 6:00 p.m. program starts
* 8:00 p.m. program ends</p>

<h3>Love Your Neighbor (ICE Out!)</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 14, 2026 at 4:00 PM UTC - 7:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>574 Valley St<br>Maplewood, NJ 07040</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Please join our peaceful protest! Let&apos;s line Valley Street and stand with our immigrant neighbors and all who are impacted by ICE/DHS/Border Patrol cruelty. It&apos;s Presidents&apos; Day weekend, so a great opportunity to express your thoughts on THAT topic too! It&apos;s also Valentine&apos;s Day, so we will mix some love songs into the playlist and have treats to keep us going. Bring your friends, your signs, your acoustic noisemakers, your warm attire, and most of all, your heart!

If you&apos;ve never been to a protest before (or it&apos;s been a while), this is a great place to start. We will have poster board and markers for anyone who would like to make a sign, and benches and a few chairs for anyone who needs a rest.

A core principle behind all ICE Out For Good events is a commitment to nonviolent action and no civil disobedience. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values, and to act lawfully at these events. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events. All events should be held in public spaces or on public property.

<h3>National Day of Lobbying: Impeach, Convict, Remove, and Defund ICE - Fayetteville, NC (NC-07; NC-09)</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, February 17, 2026 at 6:00 PM UTC - 7:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>225 Green St<br>Fayetteville, NC 28301</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> 50501Missouri</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Please also see: https://www.mobilize.us/fayettevilleresistancecoalition/event/897121/ 

On February 17th, the Fayetteville Resistance Coalition is spearheading local efforts for the National Day of Action of in-district lobbying for the IMPEACHMENT, CONVICTION, and REMOVAL of Donald Trump, Pam Bondi, Pete Hegseth, and Kristi Noem. We can no longer treat the symptoms of the disease and must remove the regime.

Join your fellow citizens alongside keynote speaker Mario Benavente outside the district office of our (absentee) Congressional Representatives, Richard Hudson and David Rouzer as we hand-deliver articles of impeachment, drafted by Citizens&apos; Impeachment, for Treason, Tyranny, and Obstruction of Justice. We The People demand Hudson and Rouzer not only introduce these articles of impeachment, we demand they lead impeachment efforts.

📝 Read the articles of impeachment here!

Along with the articles of impeachment, we are delivering signed petitions from constituents of NC&apos;s 7th and 9th Congressional Districts so our representatives know that if our representatives do not move forth with this and uphold the demands of the American people, we will replace them with those who will.

📜 PLEASE SIGN ONLY THE PETITION BELOW WHICH CORRESPONDS TO THE REPRESENTATIVE IN WHICH YOU LIVE. If you are unsure which Congressional District you live in, check here to determine which district you are in: https://www.ncleg.gov/FindYourLegislators and then sign the corresponding petition below.

▶️ David Rouzer (NC-07) 👉 https://c.org/dGWszzLN96

▶️ Richard Hudson (NC-09) 👉 https://c.org/GpGVkMgg7K</p>

<h3>Tell Target to Break-Up with ICE: Greater Cleveland Action</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 14, 2026 at 7:00 PM UTC - 8:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>27249 Chagrin Blvd<br>Woodmere, OH 44122</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Showing Up for Racial Justice</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>## This Valentine’s Day, Break Up with ICE

Across the country, our communities are under attack. ICE continues to tear families apart — and politicians and corporations like Target are enabling it.

Target has deep roots in Minnesota and enormous influence nationwide. By refusing ICE access and collaboration, Target could choose to stand on the right side of history. Instead, they are currently enabling harm.

This Valentine’s season, we’re asking you to show your love for your neighbors by taking action.

SURJ members and partners across the country will take part in Valentine’s Day–themed, nonviolent actions at Target stores to demand that Target break up with ICE — refuse ICE access, stop collaborating, and stop enabling repression in our communities. Our goal is to create a joyful, visible, and disruptive action that calls on Target to take a clear stand against ICE.

This action is rooted in nonviolence, collective care, and solidarity — and you’ll be joining a nationwide movement pushing Target to choose people over oppression.</p>

        <name>Weekly Vigil for Democracy at the Brooklyn Metropolitan Detention Center</name>
        <description><![CDATA[
<h3>Weekly Vigil for Democracy at the Brooklyn Metropolitan Detention Center</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, February 17, 2026 at 11:00 PM UTC - 12:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>116 29th St<br>Brooklyn, NY 11232</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Brooklyn</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Join us in standing up for our neighbors, held at the notorious prison in our own back yard. For years, the Metropolitan Detention Center has had a reputation for inhumane conditions: rancid food, lack of heating in winter and oppressive heat in summer. In 2020, an inmate named Jamel Floyd was killed by corrections officers by excessive use of force. Now, ICE is using the Metropolitan Detention Center to house our immigrant neighbors -- mothers, fathers, sons and daughters -- who have been taken from their homes, schools, and workplaces and held in detention.

Our fellow organizers at Good Shepherd Lutheran Church in Bay Ridge are holding for a weekly vigil outside the MDC to call for the release of ICE detainees, and to stand against the inhumane treatment of our neighbors. Supporters are invited to bring signs, to sing or play music, and to solemnly bear witness in solidarity. Together we will build and strengthen the vital community connections.

* We gather first at the corner of 3rd Avenue and 29th Street.</p>

        <name>National Day of Lobbying: Impeach, Convict, Remove, and Defund ICE - Pickerington, OH (OH-12)</name>
        <description><![CDATA[
<h3>National Day of Lobbying: Impeach, Convict, Remove, and Defund ICE - Pickerington, OH (OH-12)</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, February 17, 2026 at 5:00 PM UTC - 6:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Congressman Troy Balderson&apos;s Ohio District 12 Office<br>12931 Stonecreek Dr<br>Pickerington, OH 43147</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> 50501Missouri</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>In the first week of 2026, the administration engaged in three flagrant abuses of power: (1) an unconstitutional military strike in Venezuela, (2) the extrajudicial murder of Renee Nicole Good by a member of the ICE paramilitary force for exercising her first amendment rights, and (3) the continued obstruction of justice for victims of Jeffrey Epstein’s child sex trafficking ring. A month into 2026, the administration has escalated their unchecked aggression against allies like Greenland and countries like Cuba, Columbia, and Mexico. ICE has kidnapped preschoolers and used them as bait for their parents, and the administration is considering deploying military police to back them up.

In short: It’s not getting better and Congress is not meeting the moment. 

Democracy does not defend itself; it requires the active participation of the people. While countless Americans have already called, emailed, written letters, signed petitions, and while activist organizations have brought groups to Capitol Hill calling for impeachment, this moment demands something more visible, more direct, and more powerful: constituents showing up at congressional district offices, where staff rarely, if ever, engage with constituents.

Impeachment is not optional. It is the remedy mandated by the Constitution. Likewise, Congress holds the power to de-fund and abolish ICE. They aren’t acting because they do not have the political will to do so. So we will lend them some of ours.

WHO/WHEN:

FLARE USA, Citizens&apos; Impeachment, and 50501 Movement are proud to announce the next National Day of Action: in-district lobbying on February 17, 2026 for the impeachment of President Trump and the complete abolishment of ICE. Representatives will be in their districts; it&apos;s time to catch them at home. It&apos;s time to Remove the Regime AND abolish ICE!

Grassroots pro-democracy organizations (e.g., local chapters of Indivisible, Hands Off, 50501), progressive primary candidates, and other concerned citizens will join together in leading constituents into the local/in-district offices of all 435 US House Representatives to demand impeachment and the abolishment of ICE. 

Please see our attendee guide for more information on why we&apos;re mobilizing, specific goals, current news on impeachment, and a full guide, including scripts, for visiting and following up with your Representative&apos;s office at tinyurl.com/lobby217guide. 

By registering for the event, you are agreeing that event partners may receive your contact information and communicate with you about related activities. 

All participants are committed to lawful, non-violent action and no civil disobedience.</p>

<h3>A Time to Remember and A Time to Sing, a candlelight vigil</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Thursday, February 26, 2026 at 10:30 PM UTC - 2:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Lafayette Park<br>Corner of Fourth and Porter Street<br>Watkins Glen, NY 14891</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>This a local Indivisible event!

We will gather together to remember those who have died in ICE Custody or while peacefully protesting. We will have a short candle light vigil march from the corner of Porter Street and 4th Street, at Lafayette Park to St. James Episcopal Church in Watkins Glen. Once we reach the church, you will be offered a warm drink and cookies on your way to your seat.  We will then hold a memorial candle lighting ceremony.  At the conclusion of the ceremony, we will raise our voices in song with the help of Joe Chicone and perhaps others. 

It is our hope that this ceremony will give us an opportunity to acknowledge our distress and grief over the loss of human life at the hands of ICE.  We hope that each participant will go home feeling comforted in knowing that others share their pain and distress.  We also hope that each participant will walk away, feeling inspired and feeling a renewed sense of community...


*A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*</p>

<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Minnesota has shown us that building up a strong community connection is the best way to protect our neighbors against ICE. That&apos;s why this community weekend, neighbors from the UWS are planning a Town Hall that is one part education, one part connection and one part action.  

The day will help people learn not only how to spot ICE and what to do when that happens, but also how to strengthen our community through mutual aid, neighborhood gatherings, and volunteer work.  Equal parts presentation, discussion, and action, we aim for everyone to leave knowing more of their neighbors and feeling empowered to build together.</p>

<h3>National Day of Lobbying: Impeach, Convict, and Remove - Hickory, NC (NC-10)</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, February 17, 2026 at 8:00 PM UTC - 9:30 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Pat Harrigan&apos;s office on campus of App State Hickory<br>800 17th St NW suite g467<br>Hickory, NC 28601</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> 50501Missouri</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>In the first week of 2026, the administration engaged in three flagrant abuses of power: (1) an unconstitutional military strike in Venezuela, (2) the extrajudicial murder of Renee Nicole Good by a member of the ICE paramilitary force for exercising her first amendment rights, and (3) the continued obstruction of justice for victims of Jeffrey Epstein’s child sex trafficking ring. 

Impeachment is not optional. It is the remedy mandated by the Constitution.

FLARE USA, Citizens&apos; Impeachment, and 50501 Movement are proud to announce the next National Day of Action: in-district lobbying on February 17, 2026 for the impeachment, conviction, and removal of President Trump. Representatives will be in their districts; catch them at home and demand they use their power to remove this unconstitutional regime!

Grassroots pro-democracy organizations (e.g., local chapters of Indivisible, Hands Off, 50501), progressive primary candidates, and other concerned citizens will join together in leading constituents into the local/in-district offices of all 435 US House Representatives to demand impeachment. 

All participants are committed to lawful, non-violent action and no civil disobedience. 

Further training materials to follow soon.</p>

<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>395 E Broad St<br>Columbus, OH 43215</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Central Ohio</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>This protest is at 395 E. Broad St, across the street from the intersection of Cleveland and Broad. There is parking in the area.  

Please note that this is not an ICE facility; it&apos;s an immigration and customs office.  We protest there to take advantage of rush hour traffic and do so after the office is closed so that we won&apos;t frighten people away from their appointments.

We provide the signs, which have red lettering on a white background and say, “Stop the Cruelty.” We all use the same sign to maximize visual impact. We are a silent protest, although we do talk among ourselves. We have a policy of not hassling ICE officers who wander by. Anger and resentment are Donald Trump&apos;s tools, they&apos;re not ours. Everyone is welcome!</p>

<h3>Beacon Shine the Light Thursdays:  ICE Out for Good!</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Thursday, February 12, 2026 at 5:30 PM UTC - 6:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Bond Street &amp; Grace Avenue<br>Great Neck Plaza, NY 11021</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>This a local Indivisible event!

Join The Beacon for Thursday Shine the Light, as we bring our voices to the street every Thursday from 12:30-1:00 PM.

Each week, we make our voices heard wherever we are. As beacons, we shine light by making a sign and bringing it outside—in front of our houses, apartment buildings, to our street corners, subway stops, etc.

Our signs proudly share whatever we’re feeling in our souls in the face of this regime’s actions. Our signs might read, “I Stand With Our Immigrant Neighbors,” or “Honk if You Love Ukraine,” or “Trans Rights Are Human Rights,” or “Read Banned Books.” We encourage a POSITIVE message on all signs, and request that you do not use profanity.

In the face of increasing violence against people in Minneapolis and throughout the country by ICE agents, we stand together to express our disapproval of our government&apos;s brutality.

Together, we are building visible resistance and organized compassion, meeting our neighbors, and joining together in acts of solidarity. We find joy in resistance through community, music, comedy and street theater.

There are Beacon groups all over the USA. Our local Great Neck group meets every Thursday from 12:30-1:00 pm throughout the cold weather months.

        <name>National Day of Lobbying: Impeach, Convict, Remove, and Defund ICE Buffalo, NY (NY-26)</name>
        <description><![CDATA[
<h3>National Day of Lobbying: Impeach, Convict, Remove, and Defund ICE Buffalo, NY (NY-26)</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, February 17, 2026 at 3:00 PM UTC - 11:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Tim Kennedy<br>726 Exchange St suite 601<br>Buffalo, NY 14210</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> 50501Missouri</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>In the first week of 2026, the administration engaged in three flagrant abuses of power: (1) an unconstitutional military strike in Venezuela, (2) the extrajudicial murder of Renee Nicole Good by a member of the ICE paramilitary force for exercising her first amendment rights, and (3) the continued obstruction of justice for victims of Jeffrey Epstein’s child sex trafficking ring. A month into 2026, the administration has escalated their unchecked aggression against allies like Greenland and countries like Cuba, Columbia, and Mexico. ICE has kidnapped preschoolers and used them as bait for their parents, and the administration is considering deploying military police to back them up.

In short: It’s not getting better and Congress is not meeting the moment. 

Democracy does not defend itself; it requires the active participation of the people. While countless Americans have already called, emailed, written letters, signed petitions, and while activist organizations have brought groups to Capitol Hill calling for impeachment, this moment demands something more visible, more direct, and more powerful: constituents showing up at congressional district offices, where staff rarely, if ever, engage with constituents.

Impeachment is not optional. It is the remedy mandated by the Constitution. Likewise, Congress holds the power to de-fund and abolish ICE. They aren’t acting because they do not have the political will to do so. So we will lend them some of ours.

WHO/WHEN:

FLARE USA, Citizens&apos; Impeachment, and 50501 Movement are proud to announce the next National Day of Action: in-district lobbying on February 17, 2026 for the impeachment of President Trump and the complete abolishment of ICE. Representatives will be in their districts; it&apos;s time to catch them at home. It&apos;s time to Remove the Regime AND abolish ICE!

Grassroots pro-democracy organizations (e.g., local chapters of Indivisible, Hands Off, 50501), progressive primary candidates, and other concerned citizens will join together in leading constituents into the local/in-district offices of all 435 US House Representatives to demand impeachment and the abolishment of ICE. 

Please see our attendee guide for more information on why we&apos;re mobilizing, specific goals, current news on impeachment, and a full guide, including scripts, for visiting and following up with your Representative&apos;s office at tinyurl.com/lobby217guide. 

By registering for the event, you are agreeing that event partners may receive your contact information and communicate with you about related activities. 

All participants are committed to lawful, non-violent action and no civil disobedience.</p>

        <name>National Day of Lobbying in Stamford: Impeach/Convict/Remove &amp; Defund ICE - Stamford, CT (CT-04)</name>
        <description><![CDATA[
<h3>National Day of Lobbying in Stamford: Impeach/Convict/Remove &amp; Defund ICE - Stamford, CT (CT-04)</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, February 17, 2026 at 5:00 PM UTC - 7:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>888 Washington Blvd<br>Stamford, CT 06901</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> 50501Missouri</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Since inauguration, this administration has continuously engaged  in multiple abuses of power:  especially flagrant have been : (1) an unconstitutional military strike in Venezuela, (2) the extrajudicial murder of Keith Porter, Renee Nicole Good,  Alex Pretti, and others; and (3) the continued obstruction of justice for victims of Jeffrey Epstein’s child sex trafficking ring. 
In short: It’s not getting better and Congress is not meeting the moment. 
This moment demands something visible, direct, and powerful: we can’t wait.  We are calling for constituents to show up at their congressional district offices and demand impeachment and abolishment of ICE.
Impeachment is not optional. It is the remedy mandated by the Constitution. Likewise, Congress holds the power to de-fund and abolish ICE. They aren’t acting because they do not have the political will to do so. So we will lend them some of ours.
WHO/WHEN:
FLARE USA, Citizens&apos; Impeachment, and 50501 Movement are proud to announce the next National Day of Action: in-district lobbying on February 17, 2026 for the impeachment of President Trump and the complete abolishment of ICE.
Grassroots pro-democracy organizations (e.g., local chapters of Indivisible, Hands Off, 50501), progressive primary candidates, and other concerned citizens will join together in leading constituents into the local/in-district offices of all 435 US House Representatives to demand impeachment and the abolishment of ICE. 
Please see our attendee guide for more information on why we&apos;re mobilizing, specific goals, current news on impeachment, and a full guide, including scripts, for visiting and following up with your Representative&apos;s office at tinyurl.com/lobby217guide. 
By registering for the event, you are agreeing that event partners may receive your contact information and communicate with you about related activities. 
All participants are committed to lawful, non-violent action and no civil disobedience.</p>

<h3>Finger Lakes Peoples Union Protest Against Rep. Tenney</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Sunday, February 15, 2026 at 9:00 PM UTC - 10:30 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Rep. Claudia Tenney&apos;s Office<br>2375 Rochester Rd<br>Canandaigua, NY 14424</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Showing Up for Racial Justice</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>On Sunday, Feb 15th, starting at 4PM, FLPU and members of the local community will gather for a vigil and a peaceful protest against the Violence of ICE/CBP/ and other federal agencies. The event aims to honor those affected and emphasize resistance to this behavior as the “new” normal. This is part of a nationwide series of events through the Disappeared in America Project as well as the efforts of local Rev. Dr. Leah Ntuala, who encourages people across the country to come together to show love and solidarity with immigrant communities—and to reject the violent, intrusive, and unlawful tactics being carried out by the Trump Department of Homeland Security (DHS), including Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP).

The demonstration will include a candlelight vigil, a reading of a list of names, and a die-in. Representations of gravestones and candles will be used to individually recognize the lives lost through the tactics embraced by Rep. Tenney and the Trump administration.

Parking is available on nearby side streets Kepner Rd. and Aroline Rd. Parking is restricted in the plaza, and cars may be towed.

Sponsored by: Finger Lakes Makers Collective, People&apos;s Action, We Dissent, 5 &amp; 20 Alliance, Veterans For Peace, FLX Rapid Response, Hemlock Rising.</p>

<h3>A Nationwide Gathering for a National Vigil and Protest DHS, ICE &amp; CBP</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Sunday, February 15, 2026 at 9:00 PM UTC - 10:30 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>4250 Federal Dr<br>Batavia, NY 14020</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Genesee Valley Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Organized by Rev. Leah Ntuala   revntuala5@gmail.com

WHO: Community members; the public is encouraged to attend.

WHAT: A community vigil and protest. A Nationwide Gathering for a National Vigil and Protest  
On Sunday, February 15, members of local communities across the United States will gather simultaneously for a national vigil and peaceful protest against the violence of ICE, Customs and Border Protection, and other federal agencies. The event aims to honor those who have lost their lives, and to resist the normalization of this behavior as the “new normal.&quot;
The demonstration will include a candlelight vigil, the reading of a list of names, and a protest. Those in attendance are encouraged to lie down—or remain still in their chair, walker, or while standing—and remain motionless for 36 minutes, one minute for each name.  [Sadly, there are now more than 36 names.]

WHY: To remember those who have lost their lives and those who mourn them, and to unite in an act of resistance and courage against the normalization of the actions—or inactions—of these agencies and the federal government.</p>

<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Wednesday, January 7th, an American citizen was killed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Minneapolis, Minnesota. This killing is part of a broader and controversial pattern of unchecked violence, impunity, and abuse carried out by federal immigration enforcement agencies against members of our communities. 

A broad coalition of groups across the country is calling for a coordinated Ice Out  until they are no longer invading our communities.
On this President’s Day we will be a holding a Candlelight Vigil to remember all the people that have lost their lives to ICE. We have a President who is accountable to the citizens he serves . He is NOT A KING. We are not his subjects and he can not use ICE to control  us !

We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values, and to act lawfully at these events. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events. All events should be held in public spaces or on public property.

<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Sandusky Mall Entrance<br>4314 Milan Rd<br>Sandusky, OH 44870</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Trump is waging war and committing murder to enrich his billionaire backers. We are fighting to stop him. Stand with us and take action this weekend to demand an end to the occupation of Venezuela and our cities. We stand united demanding an end to the Venezuelan occupation and the removal of reckless untrained ICE agents from our communities.

Together we will force the administration to end the occupation of Venezuela and our cities and spread the word to our neighbors that we deserve better.

Every dollar spent in wars overseas or at home is a dollar we paid for with our taxes - a dollar that could and should go to helping our communities thrive. We can have good jobs, better schools, access to healthcare and get our basic needs met. But not while our government works for billionaires and not for us.

Join us, stand strong and speak up.

<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>In the first week of 2026, the administration engaged in three flagrant abuses of power: (1) an unconstitutional military strike in Venezuela, (2) the extrajudicial murder of Renee Nicole Good by a member of the ICE paramilitary force for exercising her first amendment rights, and (3) the continued obstruction of justice for victims of Jeffrey Epstein’s child sex trafficking ring. A month into 2026, the administration has escalated their unchecked aggression against allies like Greenland and countries like Cuba, Columbia, and Mexico. ICE has kidnapped preschoolers and used them as bait for their parents, and the administration is considering deploying military police to back them up.

In short: It’s not getting better and Congress is not meeting the moment. 

Democracy does not defend itself; it requires the active participation of the people. While countless Americans have already called, emailed, written letters, signed petitions, and while activist organizations have brought groups to Capitol Hill calling for impeachment, this moment demands something more visible, more direct, and more powerful: constituents showing up at congressional district offices, where staff rarely, if ever, engage with constituents.

Impeachment is not optional. It is the remedy mandated by the Constitution. Likewise, Congress holds the power to de-fund and abolish ICE. They aren’t acting because they do not have the political will to do so. So we will lend them some of ours.

WHO/WHEN:

FLARE USA, Citizens&apos; Impeachment, and 50501 Movement are proud to announce the next National Day of Action: in-district lobbying on February 17, 2026 for the impeachment of President Trump and the complete abolishment of ICE. Representatives will be in their districts; it&apos;s time to catch them at home. It&apos;s time to Remove the Regime AND abolish ICE!

Grassroots pro-democracy organizations (e.g., local chapters of Indivisible, Hands Off, 50501), progressive primary candidates, and other concerned citizens will join together in leading constituents into the local/in-district offices of all 435 US House Representatives to demand impeachment and the abolishment of ICE. 

Please see our attendee guide for more information on why we&apos;re mobilizing, specific goals, current news on impeachment, and a full guide, including scripts, for visiting and following up with your Representative&apos;s office at tinyurl.com/lobby217guide. 

By registering for the event, you are agreeing that event partners may receive your contact information and communicate with you about related activities. 

All participants are committed to lawful, non-violent action and no civil disobedience.</p>

<h3>Stop Tyranny</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 14, 2026 at 7:00 PM UTC - 8:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>54 Ethan Allen Hwy<br>Ridgefield, CT 06877</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Join us at the **Stop Tyranny Rally** to raise your voice and protect democracy against the Trump administration’s escalating autocratic march. We have witnessed the execution style killing of U.S. citizens including Renee Good and Alex Pretti by masked federal agents in Minneapolis, alongside the lethal bombing of Venezuelan nationals in international waters—actions that bypass every pillar of due process. While the administration&apos;s systemic corruption loots the poor and middle class to grease the pathway to riches for the powerful, a deliberate campaign is underway to subvert our elections. From suing dozens of states over voter rolls to the chilling calls for ICE agents to surround polling places, the goal is clear: to block registration, suppress the vote, and manipulate the count. This is an autocratic playbook unfolding at record speed—neutering law firms through executive targeting, attacking the independence of universities, and undermining the very science that keeps us safe. Stand with us to Stop Tyranny.

Hosted by REBS, Indivisible Fairfield County and Ridgefield Resistance

<h3>Pop up demonstration for the protection of OUR Constitution</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 14, 2026 at 4:00 PM UTC - 5:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Assemble on public sidewalks at intersection of<br>Onondaga Road &amp; West Genesee Street<br>Fairmount, NY 13219</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Onondaga County</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>To protectors of the US Constitution,

Mark Twain wrote, “Patriotism is supporting your country all of the time and your government when it deserves it”. We currently have a government regime led by a cruel, corrupt, lawless pathological liar supported by a group of authoritarian gaslighting sycophants. This regime does not deserve our support. It deserves our resistance!

The Framers of the U.S. Constitution created the Bill of Rights and placed Freedom of Assembly, Speech, and Petition of government grievances in the First Amendment in order for action to be taken in times like these.

EVERY SINGLE DAY this regime is violating our Constitution. This regime is invading sovereign countries. Masked lawless federal “agents” are kidnapping our neighbors and now killing citizens in our neighborhoods.

To be clear, we respect and appreciate ethical and community-minded law enforcement officers. We RESIST brutality, lawlessness, and lack of accountability by ICE.

This rally is part of a campaign of recurring “pop-up” rallies at various locations throughout Onondaga County Saturdays 11-12pm. New weekly location will be announced every Monday for that Friday. Raise your voice with a community of protectors of the Constitution and human rights by peacefully assembling together to exercise our First Amendment rights!

In the influential footsteps of Gandhi,  Dr. King, Thich Nhat Hahn, and Susan B Anthony, non-violence is not only a strategy for direct action to save our democracy, but a shared value in our personal conduct. We are a peaceful, yet assertive movement. Any suggestion otherwise is propaganda. We denounce political violence in the clearest and strongest possible terms. 

Additionally, we are an organization of VOLUNTEER activists, organizers, concerned community members, and other protectors of our Constitution. We care about our community and our country. We RESIST authoritarianism from the megalomaniac in the White House. We are NOT paid. Any suggestion otherwise is propaganda. 

In solidarity,

Chad</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
<h3>National Day of Lobbying: Impeach, Convict, Remove, and Defund ICE - New Haven, CT (CT-03)</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, February 17, 2026 at 2:30 PM UTC - 4:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>DeLauro&apos;s District Office<br>59 Elm St<br>New Haven, CT 06510</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> 50501Missouri</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>In the first week of 2026, the administration engaged in three flagrant abuses of power: (1) an unconstitutional military strike in Venezuela, (2) the extrajudicial murder of Renee Nicole Good by a member of the ICE paramilitary force for exercising her first amendment rights, and (3) the continued obstruction of justice for victims of Jeffrey Epstein’s child sex trafficking ring. A month into 2026, the administration has escalated their unchecked aggression against allies like Greenland and countries like Cuba, Columbia, and Mexico. ICE has kidnapped preschoolers and used them as bait for their parents, and the administration is considering deploying military police to back them up.

In short: It’s not getting better and Congress is not meeting the moment. 

Democracy does not defend itself; it requires the active participation of the people. While countless Americans have already called, emailed, written letters, signed petitions, and while activist organizations have brought groups to Capitol Hill calling for impeachment, this moment demands something more visible, more direct, and more powerful: constituents showing up at congressional district offices, where staff rarely, if ever, engage with constituents.

Impeachment is not optional. It is the remedy mandated by the Constitution. Likewise, Congress holds the power to de-fund and abolish ICE. They aren’t acting because they do not have the political will to do so. So we will lend them some of ours.

WHO/WHEN:

FLARE USA, Citizens&apos; Impeachment, and 50501 Movement are proud to announce the next National Day of Action: in-district lobbying on February 17, 2026 for the impeachment of President Trump and the complete abolishment of ICE. Representatives will be in their districts; it&apos;s time to catch them at home. It&apos;s time to Remove the Regime AND abolish ICE!

Grassroots pro-democracy organizations (e.g., local chapters of Indivisible, Hands Off, 50501), progressive primary candidates, and other concerned citizens will join together in leading constituents into the local/in-district offices of all 435 US House Representatives to demand impeachment and the abolishment of ICE. 

Please see our attendee guide for more information on why we&apos;re mobilizing, specific goals, current news on impeachment, and a full guide, including scripts, for visiting and following up with your Representative&apos;s office at tinyurl.com/lobby217guide. 

By registering for the event, you are agreeing that event partners may receive your contact information and communicate with you about related activities. 

All participants are committed to lawful, non-violent action and no civil disobedience.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
<h3>National Day of Lobbying: Impeach, Convict, Remove, and Defund ICE - Hendersonville, NC (NC-11)</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, February 17, 2026 at 3:00 PM UTC - 10:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>200 N Grove St<br>Hendersonville, NC 28792</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> 50501Missouri</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>In the first week of 2026, the administration engaged in three flagrant abuses of power: (1) an unconstitutional military strike in Venezuela, (2) the extrajudicial murder of Renee Nicole Good by a member of the ICE paramilitary force for exercising her first amendment rights, and (3) the continued obstruction of justice for victims of Jeffrey Epstein’s child sex trafficking ring. A month into 2026, the administration has escalated their unchecked aggression against allies like Greenland and countries like Cuba, Columbia, and Mexico. ICE has kidnapped preschoolers and used them as bait for their parents, and the administration is considering deploying military police to back them up.

In short: It’s not getting better and Congress is not meeting the moment. 

Democracy does not defend itself; it requires the active participation of the people. While countless Americans have already called, emailed, written letters, signed petitions, and while activist organizations have brought groups to Capitol Hill calling for impeachment, this moment demands something more visible, more direct, and more powerful: constituents showing up at congressional district offices, where staff rarely, if ever, engage with constituents.

Impeachment is not optional. It is the remedy mandated by the Constitution. Likewise, Congress holds the power to de-fund and abolish ICE. 

LOCAL CALL TO ACTION

FLARE USA and the Asheville Fights Back Network join the National Day of Action: in-district lobbying on February 17, 2026 for the impeachment of President Trump and the complete abolishment of ICE. Representatives will be in their districts; it&apos;s time to catch them at home. 

Stand united with us as we show this administration we will not be silent. We will not be complicit. And we will not accept their lies or incompetence. 

The people have power. We have power in our labor. Power in our spending. Power in our voting. 

Let&apos;s show how powerful we can be.

Call out of work.

Don&apos;t spend money. Buy local if you have to.

DETAILS

Meet us at 10AM on February 17th at Chuck Edward&apos;s local office: 200 N Grove Street Ste 121, Hendersonville, NC to remind Chuck that he works for us!

THEN

Join us at 3PM at Pack Square for a rally. Come together as we raise our voices and build a stronger community.

<h3>National Day of Lobbying: Impeach, Convict, Remove, and Defund ICE - Waterbury, CT (CT-05)</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, February 17, 2026 at 7:30 PM UTC - 9:30 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>108 Bank St<br>Waterbury, CT 06702</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> 50501Missouri</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>In the first week of 2026, the administration engaged in three flagrant abuses of power: (1) an unconstitutional military strike in Venezuela, (2) the extrajudicial murder of Renee Nicole Good by a member of the ICE paramilitary force for exercising her first amendment rights, and (3) the continued obstruction of justice for victims of Jeffrey Epstein’s child sex trafficking ring.

Impeachment is not optional. It is the remedy mandated by the Constitution. Likewise, Congress holds the power to de-fund and abolish ICE. They aren’t acting because they do not have the political will to do so. So we will lend them some of ours.

WHO/WHEN:

FLARE USA, Citizens&apos; Impeachment, and 50501 Movement are proud to announce the next National Day of Action: in-district lobbying on February 17, 2026 for the impeachment of President Trump and the complete abolishment of ICE. Representatives will be in their districts; it&apos;s time to catch them at home. It&apos;s time to Remove the Regime AND abolish ICE!

Grassroots pro-democracy organizations (e.g., local chapters of Indivisible, Hands Off, 50501), progressive primary candidates, and other concerned citizens will join together in leading constituents into the local/in-district offices of all 435 US House Representatives to demand impeachment and the abolishment of ICE.

        <name>ICE Out For Good - Nonviolence Workshop in Lexington</name>
        <description><![CDATA[
<h3>ICE Out For Good - Nonviolence Workshop in Lexington</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Monday, February 16, 2026 at 11:00 PM UTC - 1:30 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>The Willow - a blooming collective<br>825 National Ave<br>Lexington, KY 40502</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Three American citizens have been killed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) since New Years Eve. These murders are part of a broader pattern of unchecked violence, impunity, and abuse carried out by federal immigration enforcement agencies against members of our communities. 

A core principle behind all ICE Out For Good events is a commitment to nonviolent action. Join Progress Kentucky for a workshop to walk through WHY nonviolence is a critical strategy for effective resistance, with a historical lens. 

While the Montgomery Bus Boycott and the nonviolent actions taken during the Civil Rights Movement are portrayed as spontaneous events, as results of folks just being tired, they were actually carefully designed and the activists were trained before going out to take action. 

We are offering a workshop in which we dig deeper into the concept of nonviolence, what it is and why it works. The workshop will include information and training about non-violent direct action, your rights as a protester, and de-escalation in the face of opposition. 

This training is a starter session, and will include a Know Your Rights briefing.

We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values, and to act lawfully at these events. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events. 

Indivisible is managing data and communications with participants. By registering, you agree to receive info from Indivisible about the event, receive communications via e-mail or SMS message from Indivisible, and receive any other updates and opportunities to take action or support ICE OUT FOR GOOD partner organizations. You also agree to have any data entered in this registration collected by Indivisible. Indivisible will treat your data according to our organization’s applicable privacy policy: https://indivisible.org/privacy-policy</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
<h3>National Day of Lobbying: Impeach, Convict, and Remove TOLEDO (OH-09)</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, February 17, 2026 at 8:00 PM UTC - 10:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Marcy Kaptur Office<br>1 Maritime Plaza<br>Toledo, OH 43604</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> 50501Missouri</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>In the first week of 2026, the administration engaged in three flagrant abuses of power: (1) an unconstitutional military strike in Venezuela, (2) the extrajudicial murder of Renee Nicole Good by a member of the ICE paramilitary force for exercising her first amendment rights, and (3) the continued obstruction of justice for victims of Jeffrey Epstein’s child sex trafficking ring. A month into 2026, the administration has escalated their unchecked aggression against allies like Greenland and countries like Cuba, Columbia, and Mexico. ICE has kidnapped preschoolers and used them as bait for their parents, and the administration is considering deploying military police to back them up.

In short: It’s not getting better and Congress is not meeting the moment. 

Democracy does not defend itself; it requires the active participation of the people. While countless Americans have already called, emailed, written letters, signed petitions, and while activist organizations have brought groups to Capitol Hill calling for impeachment, this moment demands something more visible, more direct, and more powerful: constituents showing up at congressional district offices, where staff rarely, if ever, engage with constituents.

Impeachment is not optional. It is the remedy mandated by the Constitution.

WHO/WHEN:

FLARE USA, Citizens&apos; Impeachment, and 50501 Movement are proud to announce the next National Day of Action: in-district lobbying on February 17, 2026 for the impeachment, conviction, and removal of President Trump. Representatives will be in their districts; catch them at home and demand they use their power to remove this unconstitutional regime!

Grassroots pro-democracy organizations (e.g., local chapters of Indivisible, Hands Off, 50501), progressive primary candidates, and other concerned citizens will join together in leading constituents into the local/in-district offices of all 435 US House Representatives to demand impeachment. 

Please see our attendee guide for more information on why we&apos;re mobilizing, specific goals, current news on impeachment, and a full guide, including scripts, for visiting and following up with your Representative&apos;s office at tinyurl.com/lobby217guide. 

By registering for the event, you are agreeing that event partners may receive your contact information and communicate with you about related activities. 

All participants are committed to lawful, non-violent action and no civil disobedience.</p>

        <name>National Day of Lobbying: Impeach, Convict, Remove, and Defund ICE - Surfside Beach, SC (SC-07)</name>
        <description><![CDATA[
<h3>National Day of Lobbying: Impeach, Convict, Remove, and Defund ICE - Surfside Beach, SC (SC-07)</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, February 17, 2026 at 5:30 PM UTC - 7:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Russel Fry&apos;s Primary local office<br>1500 US-17 BUS ste 304<br>Surfside Beach, SC 29575</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> 50501Missouri</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>In the first week of 2026, the administration engaged in three flagrant abuses of power: (1) an unconstitutional military strike in Venezuela, (2) the extrajudicial murder of Renee Nicole Good by a member of the ICE paramilitary force for exercising her first amendment rights, and (3) the continued obstruction of justice for victims of Jeffrey Epstein’s child sex trafficking ring. A month into 2026, the administration has escalated their unchecked aggression against allies like Greenland and countries like Cuba, Columbia, and Mexico. ICE has kidnapped preschoolers and used them as bait for their parents, and the administration is considering deploying military police to back them up.

In short: It’s not getting better and Congress is not meeting the moment. 

Democracy does not defend itself; it requires the active participation of the people. While countless Americans have already called, emailed, written letters, signed petitions, and while activist organizations have brought groups to Capitol Hill calling for impeachment, this moment demands something more visible, more direct, and more powerful: constituents showing up at congressional district offices, where staff rarely, if ever, engage with constituents.

Impeachment is not optional. It is the remedy mandated by the Constitution. Likewise, Congress holds the power to de-fund and abolish ICE. They aren’t acting because they do not have the political will to do so. So we will lend them some of ours.

WHO/WHEN:

FLARE USA, Citizens&apos; Impeachment, and 50501 Movement are proud to announce the next National Day of Action: in-district lobbying on February 17, 2026 for the impeachment of President Trump and the complete abolishment of ICE. Representatives will be in their districts; it&apos;s time to catch them at home. It&apos;s time to Remove the Regime AND abolish ICE!

Grassroots pro-democracy organizations (e.g., local chapters of Indivisible, Hands Off, 50501), progressive primary candidates, and other concerned citizens will join together in leading constituents into the local/in-district offices of all 435 US House Representatives to demand impeachment and the abolishment of ICE. 

Please see our attendee guide for more information on why we&apos;re mobilizing, specific goals, current news on impeachment, and a full guide, including scripts, for visiting and following up with your Representative&apos;s office at tinyurl.com/lobby217guide. 

By registering for the event, you are agreeing that event partners may receive your contact information and communicate with you about related activities. 

All participants are committed to lawful, non-violent action and no civil disobedience.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
<h3>The People’s Day Protest</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Monday, February 16, 2026 at 5:00 PM UTC - 6:30 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Falls Park on the Reedy<br>601 S Main St<br>Greenville, SC 29601</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Upstate SC</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>On Presidents’ Day, we will protest then gather for a rally in the park to remind our community that We the People are the government. Our leaders are public servants, elected to protect us, represent us, and act in our best interests. This day is not about glorifying power, it is about remembering where power belongs, with the people. 
Across South Carolina, legislators are advancing policies that serve political ambition rather than the people. This protest is a call to expose that betrayal and remind those in office that their loyalty must be to the public, not authoritarian agendas.

Right now, controversial legislation moving through hearings includes near total abortion restrictions, efforts to close open primaries and limit voter choice, attacks on transgender students’ rights, mandates expanding ICE cooperation by local law enforcement, and changes to judicial selection that threaten court independence.

The People’s Day Protest is about dissent, accountability, and action. We refuse to be silent while democracy is weakened. We stand together to say clearly, we will not surrender our rights or our power.
This is our moment to rise, to contact our representatives, to get involved, and to make our voices impossible to ignore.

On Presidents’ Day, we choose the people. We choose freedom. We choose to dissent.</p>

<h3>We the People Dissent Bi-Monthly Grand Circus Protest THEMED: ABOLISH ICE</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Sunday, February 15, 2026 at 6:00 PM UTC - 7:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Grand Circus Park<br><br>Détroit, MI 48226</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>THEME: ABOLISH ICE.
Join us for an hour of action at Grand Circus Park in Downtown Detroit. Let&apos;s give the resistance in Detroit some good visibility, educate people about the democratic crisis we are deep in with flyering and conversations. We have banners, but feel free to bring your best sign! Make sure you come with water and a snack in your backpack, warm gloves, several layers of sweaters under your winter coat, long johns, scarf, and winter hat. Heated socks sound like a good idea too.

At 1PM, we will start at the corner of Adams &amp; Woodward, just next to Central Methodist Church. We may decide to move to a different corner depending on where the crowd flows, but the meeting point at 1 PM is just outside the Church!

On Sundays, street parking is free. You can also park in the church parking lot. Mention at the gate that you are here for the protest. If you cannot find street parking available near Grand Circus, we recommend that you drive up Woodward a bit, where you can park anywhere for free, then hop on the Q-Line (free too!) to Grand Circus. 

*A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*</p>

<h3>National Day of Lobbying: Impeach, Convict, Remove, and Defund ICE   HARTFORD CT (CT-01)</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, February 17, 2026 at 3:00 PM UTC - 11:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Campus Commons (Rep Larsen&apos;s office)<br>361 Main St 3rd floor<br>East Hartford, CT 06118</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> 50501Missouri</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>In the first week of 2026, the administration engaged in three flagrant abuses of power: (1) an unconstitutional military strike in Venezuela, (2) the extrajudicial murder of Renee Nicole Good by a member of the ICE paramilitary force for exercising her first amendment rights, and (3) the continued obstruction of justice for victims of Jeffrey Epstein’s child sex trafficking ring.

In short: It’s not getting better and Congress is not meeting the moment. 

Democracy does not defend itself; it requires the active participation of the people. While countless Americans have already called, emailed, written letters, signed petitions, and while activist organizations have brought groups to Capitol Hill calling for impeachment, this moment demands something more visible, more direct, and more powerful: constituents showing up at congressional district offices, where staff rarely, if ever, engage with constituents.

Impeachment is not optional. It is the remedy mandated by the Constitution. Likewise, Congress holds the power to de-fund and abolish ICE. They aren’t acting because they do not have the political will to do so. So we will lend them some of ours.

        <description><![CDATA[
<h3>Citizens&apos; Bank: STOP  FUNDING ICE PRISONS!</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 21, 2026 at 4:00 PM UTC - 5:30 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Citizens Bank<br>354 Broad St<br>Manchester, CT 06040</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Quiet Corner Indivisible-CT</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>ICE relies on private prison companies to build and operate their inhumane immigration detention facilities. Those private prison companies, in turn, rely on financial institutions -- institutions like Citizens Bank. Citizens Bank is complicit in the evils of the private prison industry; we want to persuade them that this is bad for business, and that a &apos;community bank&apos; shouldn&apos;t be supporting immigration jails.

We&apos;ll gather on the public sidewalk in front of the Citizens Bank branch at 354 Broad Street in Manchester CT on February 21, from 11:00-12:30. Cancellation only for severe weather. Please park nearby, e.g. in the larger shopping area down/across the street (near Ollie&apos;s) -- please don&apos;t park in the bank parking lot, nor at the small truck repair business directly across the street.

Please bring signs specific to this action: Cages Aren&apos;t Communities; Citizens Bank - Stop Financing ICE Prisons; Citizens Bank + ICE = Human Rights Abuse; ICE Prisons - Bad For Communities; Citizens Bank- Divest From ICE; Your Deposits Support Private Prisons, etc. Use your imagination, but please stay on topic.

BACKGROUND:

Notorious private prison companies The GEO Group and CoreCivic are expected to be part of an unprecedented expansion in capacity as part of the Trump administration&apos;s mass detention, deportation, and surveillance policies.

To accommodate this planned increase in detention capacity, GEO and CoreCivic must undertake expensive construction and renovation projects. Since 2019, though, most of their lenders have cut ties with the two companies, which have faced allegations ranging from forced labor to securities fraud.​

In sharp contrast, ​Citizens Bank has embraced its growing relationship with the private prison industry, taking on new roles in financing both CoreCivic and GEO -- all the while advertising their commitment to strengthening our communities.

<h3>ICE OUT OF HOME DEPOT</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Monday, February 16, 2026 at 6:00 PM UTC - 7:30 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>The Home Depot<br>555 Hubbard Ave<br>Pittsfield, MA 01201</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>ICE OUT OF HOME DEPOT

This a local Indivisible event!

Home Depot profits from immigrant labor—on construction sites, in disaster recovery, and beyond. Yet, when immigrant workers are targeted by ICE raids, harassment, and arrests, Home Depot remains silent. This silence is complicity.
Immigrant workers and day laborers are the backbone of our communities, but they are also the first to face criminalization, racism, and violence. ICE raids are tearing families apart and creating fear in neighborhoods across the country.
We cannot stand by while this injustice continues. Together, we can demand accountability from Home Depot and protect the workers who make our communities thrive.

*A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
<h3>National Day of Lobbying: Impeach, Convict, and Remove |  Knoxville TN (TN-02)</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, February 17, 2026 at 7:00 PM UTC - 9:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>City-County Building<br>400 Main St SW<br>Knoxville, TN 37902</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> 50501Missouri</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>In the first week of 2026, the administration engaged in three flagrant abuses of power: (1) an unconstitutional military strike in Venezuela, (2) the extrajudicial murder of Renee Nicole Good by a member of the ICE paramilitary force for exercising her first amendment rights, and (3) the continued obstruction of justice for victims of Jeffrey Epstein’s child sex trafficking ring. A month into 2026, the administration has escalated their unchecked aggression against allies like Greenland and countries like Cuba, Columbia, and Mexico. ICE has kidnapped preschoolers and used them as bait for their parents, and the administration is considering deploying military police to back them up.

In short: It’s not getting better and Congress is not meeting the moment. 

Democracy does not defend itself; it requires the active participation of the people. While countless Americans have already called, emailed, written letters, signed petitions, and while activist organizations have brought groups to Capitol Hill calling for impeachment, this moment demands something more visible, more direct, and more powerful: constituents showing up at congressional district offices, where staff rarely, if ever, engage with constituents.

Impeachment is not optional. It is the remedy mandated by the Constitution.

WHO/WHEN:

FLARE USA, Citizens&apos; Impeachment, and 50501 Movement are proud to announce the next National Day of Action: in-district lobbying on February 17, 2026 for the impeachment, conviction, and removal of President Trump. Representatives will be in their districts; catch them at home and demand they use their power to remove this unconstitutional regime!

Grassroots pro-democracy organizations (e.g., local chapters of Indivisible, Hands Off, 50501), progressive primary candidates, and other concerned citizens will join together in leading constituents into the local/in-district offices of all 435 US House Representatives to demand impeachment. 

Please see our attendee guide for more information on why we&apos;re mobilizing, specific goals, current news on impeachment, and a full guide, including scripts, for visiting and following up with your Representative&apos;s office at tinyurl.com/lobby217guide.

All participants are committed to lawful, non-violent action and no civil disobedience.</p>

<h3>Demand Acountability For ICE</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Wednesday, February 11, 2026 at 5:00 AM UTC - 5:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> United Volunteers of Tennessee At UTK</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>We have watched our neighbors being harassed, kidnapped, and murdered for too long. Congress has enabled ICE to become completely renegade with zero oversight from anyone. We must remind our lawmakers that they work for us and if they refuse to do their job of oversight then we will kick them out. Join us in a petition drive to demand Representative Tim Burchett to push for the BARE MINIMUM of reforms to show he cares at all about preventing a rouge agency from abusing our neighbors. We demand

- A requirement for body/helmet cams to be utilized during all removal operations and agents are forbidden from intentionally disabling them while conducting immigration operations.
- ban on all face coverings used to obscure the identities of immigration officers during operations.
- A mandate that all members of ICE, Border Patrol, and other federal law enforcement involved in operations wear some form of uniform identification such as a badge to indicate 
- An immediate independent investigation into the nearly 40 deaths caused under the watch of immigration officials.
- The creation of a public database including all individuals currently held by Immigration authorities along with their immigration status.

If he won&apos;t accept these basic demands that no reasonable person should be able to object to, he has no right to govern. This petition will be printed and presented to Rep. Burchett&apos;s office on 1/17</p>

<h3>ICE Out For Good Oak Park</h3>

<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Parkwoods Plaza Shopping Center<br>W 10 Mile Rd<br>Oak Park, MI 48237</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Wednesday, January 7th, an American citizen was killed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Minneapolis, Minnesota. This killing is part of a broader pattern of unchecked violence, impunity, and abuse carried out by federal immigration enforcement agencies against members of our communities. 

A broad coalition of groups across the country is calling for a coordinated Ice Out For Good Weekend of Action on Saturday, January 10th and Sunday, January 11th to demand accountability, honor the life lost, and make visible the human cost of ICE’s actions. 

A core principle behind all ICE Out For Good events is a commitment to nonviolent action and no civil disobedience. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values, and to act lawfully at these events. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events. All events should be held in public spaces or on public property.

<h3>Love Without Borders: Valentine Care for Immigrant Neighbors</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 14, 2026 at 4:00 PM UTC - 6:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>West 10 Mile Road &amp; Coolidge Highway, Southeast Corner<br>Oak Park, MI 48237</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Oak Park Concerned Citizens</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>This Valentine&apos;s Day, we invite you to join us in sending love to our immigrant neighbors through a mutual aid drive. As ICE agents descend on the Metro Detroit area in numbers not yet seen, terrorizing and kidnapping our immigrant neighbors with disregard for the law, the Constitution or human rights, the need for us to step up to protect and assist those most impacted grows exponentially. 

These neighbors are afraid to go to work, to go to the store, to go to school. And while we are not at the point where we can prevent all these kidnappings and detainments, there are ways we can step into the gap and offer practical support.

By contributing to our mutual aid drive through donating non-perishable food items, household items and personal care items, we as a community can stand in solidarity with our immigrant neighbors, sending the powerful message that our community cares, and no one is alone.

Together, we can turn Valentine&apos;s Day into a day of courage, care and community - showing that love truly knows no borders.

We hope you will join us. Items can be dropped off anytime during the designated event times 11:00am-1:00pm. Donations will go to three different MetroDetroit organizations who are protecting and interacting with our immigrant neighbors on a daily basis - CAFE in Pontiac, People&apos;s Assembly in Detroit, and Dearborn Area Mutual Aid.

Let&apos;s make this Valentine&apos;s Day about more than just flowers, chocolates and Hallmark.

With Gratitude and in Solidarity, 
Concerned Citizens Oak Park Area</p>

<h3>Citizen&apos;s Bank - Stop Funding ICE Prisons</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, March 7, 2026 at 4:00 PM UTC - 5:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Public Sidewalk Near Citizens Bank - Main Street, Springfield<br>950 Main St<br>Springfield, MA 01103</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Rise Up Western Mass Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Citizens Bank publicly presents itself as a community-centered institution committed to social responsibility. Yet the bank continues to maintain key financial relationships with CoreCivic and The GEO Group: two notorious, for-profit, prison corporations that build and operate immigration detention facilities for ICE, provide transportation services to ICE, and operate prisons for mass incarceration. For more information about Citizens Bank’s relationship to the private prison system, go to boycottcitizens.org.

In response, a coalition of progressive organizations from Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and beyond will hold peaceful, coordinated standouts near regional Citizens Bank branches on Saturday, January 24, 2026. 

An interactive map of participating locations is available here:  https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=1AqRhnn9dpUufZYdnkwFm6cDhqDWM6Tc&amp;ll=42.47280688951886%2C-71.8565222&amp;z=9

Bring your signs: 
Cages Aren’t Communities
De-ICE Citizens Bank
Citizens Bank: Invest in Communities, Not Cages
End Mass Incarceration
Say NO to CoreCivic and The GEO Group
No Banks for Cages

People Over Prison Profits
The coalition calls upon Citizens Bank to live up to its stated values by publicly committing to end its financial relationships with private prison and detention contractors as soon as legally possible. These actions are intended to send a clear message: corporations and financial institutions that enable harmful immigration and detention policies must be held accountable by the communities they claim to serve.

A core principle behind all of these events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values and to act lawfully at these events. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events. Please do not block business entrances or traffic.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
<h3>National Day of Lobbying: Impeach, Convict, Remove, and Defund ICE - Norwich, CT (CT-02)</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, February 17, 2026 at 3:00 PM UTC - 11:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Congressman Joe Courtney&apos;s Norwich District Address<br>55 Main St Suite 250<br>Norwich, CT 06360</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> 50501Missouri</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>In the first week of 2026, the administration engaged in three flagrant abuses of power: (1) an unconstitutional military strike in Venezuela, (2) the extrajudicial murder of Renee Nicole Good by a member of the ICE paramilitary force for exercising her first amendment rights, and (3) the continued obstruction of justice for victims of Jeffrey Epstein’s child sex trafficking ring. A month into 2026, the administration has escalated their unchecked aggression against allies like Greenland and countries like Cuba, Columbia, and Mexico. ICE has kidnapped preschoolers and used them as bait for their parents, and the administration is considering deploying military police to back them up.

In short: It’s not getting better and Congress is not meeting the moment. 

Democracy does not defend itself; it requires the active participation of the people. While countless Americans have already called, emailed, written letters, signed petitions, and while activist organizations have brought groups to Capitol Hill calling for impeachment, this moment demands something more visible, more direct, and more powerful: constituents showing up at congressional district offices, where staff rarely, if ever, engage with constituents.

Impeachment is not optional. It is the remedy mandated by the Constitution. Likewise, Congress holds the power to de-fund and abolish ICE. They aren’t acting because they do not have the political will to do so. So we will lend them some of ours.

WHO/WHEN:

FLARE USA, Citizens&apos; Impeachment, and 50501 Movement are proud to announce the next National Day of Action: in-district lobbying on February 17, 2026 for the impeachment of President Trump and the complete abolishment of ICE. Representatives will be in their districts; it&apos;s time to catch them at home. It&apos;s time to Remove the Regime AND abolish ICE!

Grassroots pro-democracy organizations (e.g., local chapters of Indivisible, Hands Off, 50501), progressive primary candidates, and other concerned citizens will join together in leading constituents into the local/in-district offices of all 435 US House Representatives to demand impeachment and the abolishment of ICE.

<h3>National Day of Lobbying: Impeach, Convict, Remove, and Defund ICE Springfield, MA (MA-01)</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, February 17, 2026 at 2:00 PM UTC - 10:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Representative Richard E Neal&apos;s Office<br>300 State St 200<br>Springfield, MA 01105</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> 50501Missouri</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>## This is NOT a protest or a rally – this is a coordinated day of lobbying. If you would like to participate, we ask that you sign up on Mobilize and/or email outreach@mass50501.org.

[Mass 50501](https://www.mass50501.org/), [Indivisible Mass Coalition](https://indivisible-ma.org/), and multiple organizations from across the state of Massachusetts, in coordination with the 50501 Movement, FLARE USA, &amp; Citizens’ Impeachment, are joining forces for the National Day of Lobbying for impeachment.

Last year, on Presidents’ Day, we rallied to say **No Kings on Presidents’ Day!!** This year, we’re taking that energy directly to our representatives.

On February 17th, 2026, we will hold organized meetings with congressional offices in every district in Massachusetts. We are currently building teams in each district. **If you would like to participate, please RSVP here or email outreach@mass50501.org. We want to be as effective as possible so we are capping each team at 20.** There will be community building events happening following the congressional visit. **Exact meeting time will be communicated once teams are established.**

This is an opportunity to show directly that constituents demand better. We will not be satisfied with empty promises. We want leaders who will honor their oath and [do their job](https://citizensimpeachment.com/all-were-asking-is-for-you-to-do-your-job-congress/): Defending the Constitution by impeaching Donald Trump.

You make this fight possible. And your direct action is more important than ever. Together, we will hold this administration accountable.</p>

<h3>Citizens Bank Holyoke: Stop Financing ICE Prisons</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, March 7, 2026 at 4:00 PM UTC - 5:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Public sidewalk in front of Citizens Bank Holyoke Branch<br>1575 Northampton St<br>Holyoke, MA 01040</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Northampton-Swing Left Western MA</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>WE ARE DOING IT AGAIN!

Join others at dozens of Citizen Bank branches in VA, DC, NJ, PA, OH, NY, RI, CT, MA and VT to send them a clear message: financing private prison and immigration detention facility operators The GEO Group and CoreCivic is bad for business.

We&apos;ll stand out on the public sidewalks in front of the Bank. Sponsored by The Real Majority Holyoke.

Please only bring signs specific to this action: De-ICE Citizens Bank; Cages Aren&apos;t Communities; Citizens Bank - Stop Financing ICE prisons; Citizens Bank + ICE = Human Rights Abuse; ICE Prisons Don&apos;t Strengthen Our Communities; Citizens Bank- Cut Ties With ICE Prisons; etc. 

Notorious private prison companies The GEO Group and CoreCivic are being called on to be part of an unprecedented expansion in capacity as part of the Trump administration&apos;s mass detention, deportation, and surveillance policies. 

To accommodate the planned increase in detention capacity, GEO and CoreCivic must undertake expensive construction and renovation projects. Since 2019, though, most of their lenders have cut ties with the two companies, which have faced allegations from forced labor to securities fraud.​

​Citizens Bank has instead deepened its relationship with the private prison industry, taking on new roles in financing both CoreCivic and GEO, all while continuing to tell their customers that they&apos;re focused on strengthening our communities.

We won&apos;t quietly stand by as Citizens continues to finance the private prison &amp; ICE detention companies that are harming our communities. The 2019 exodus of banks from the industry in response to activism should be a reminder to us that our voices matter. Now it&apos;s time to use them. Visit https://www.boycottcitizens.org/ for more information.

A core principle behind all of these events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values and to act lawfully (without civil disobedience) at these events. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events. Please do not block business entrances or traffic. All participants and cosponsors must follow our Protest Guidelines - https://www.tinyurl.com/INSLWMguidelines</p>

<h3>PROTEST - CITIZENS BANK - WESTERLY 11am-Noon SAT MARCH 7th</h3>

<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> South County Rising RI</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Are you horrified by ICE?

Join South County Rising on Saturday, March 7th, 2026 from 11am -12pm as we stand out at Citizens Bank branch at 112 Franklin St in Westerly, RI to demand that they stop financing ICE prisons.

WE WILL HAVE OUR OVERPASS LETTERS SPELLING OUT ***ICE IS GESTAPO*** for folks to hold up.  And the Hotline #

We need at least 12 people.  Feel free to bring signs as well.  Dress warm!

Notorious private prison companies The GEO Group and CoreCivic are being called on to be part of an unprecedented expansion in capacity as part of the Trump administration’s mass detention, deportation, and surveillance policies.

Citizens Bank says it’s strengthening communities, but has continued financing CoreCivic and GEO Group as other lenders have cut ties. Private prisons and the mass detention, deportation, and surveillance of immigrants don’t strengthen our communities; they hurt our neighbors. Citizens must stop financing CoreCivic and GEO Group.

A core principle behind all our events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.</p>

<h3>Home Depot--Say NO to ICE--back at Home Depot!</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 14, 2026 at 5:00 PM UTC - 6:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>344 Russell St, Hadley, MA<br>Hadley, MA 01035</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Northampton-Swing Left Western MA</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>We&apos;re standing on Route 9 near Home Depot, with signs urging drivers to boycott Home Depot until they say NO to ICE.  We also have some other tricks up our sleeve.

Please bring signs specific to not buying from Home Depot.  And please sign up--if the weather turns out to be terrible, we can let you know if we have to cancel.
 
ICE has been targeting Home Depot parking lots across the country, where day labor people (often immigrants) gather to pick up work.  ICE just swoops in and grabs people.  Home Depot&apos;s response--silence.   So we are telling people to boycott Home Depot until they tell ICE to stay out of their parking lots (which are their private property.)</p>

<h3>Home Depot Hadley--SPECIAL VALENTINES ACTION!</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 14, 2026 at 4:00 PM UTC - 6:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>350 Russell St<br>Hadley, MA 01035</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Northampton-Swing Left Western MA</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>We love our rights. Home Depot (apparently) loves ICE. 

We are planning a special Valentine&apos;s Day In-Store Action at the Hadley Home Depot. Home Depot allows ICE to come into their (private property) parking lots and kidnap immigrants who are day laborers looking for work. They need to stop. There&apos;s a national campaign to boycott Home Depot until they shape up.   

We&apos;re going to assemble outside the store, then march through (and through) the store carrying signs and handing out leaflets to customers.  Those who wish may also, as in other parts of the country, line up to buy, and then to return an item, in order to jam up business.  Rinse and repeat. 

If told to leave, the person told should leave--otherwise you could be charged with trespassing. We are not planning to risk arrest (this time.) 

We will meet ahead of time at a pre-arranged location. Please register and we will send further details.

Those who wish can also do our usual noontime standout on Rte 9.  Signs should be  Home Depot themed (extra points to those who also bring a Valentines theme to their signs!)

Commitment to nonviolent action: A core principle is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values and to act lawfully at these events.</p>

<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>## This Valentine’s Day, Break Up with ICE

Across the country, our communities are under attack. ICE continues to tear families apart — and politicians and corporations like Target are enabling it.

Target has deep roots in Minnesota and enormous influence nationwide. By refusing ICE access and collaboration, Target could choose to stand on the right side of history. Instead, they are currently enabling harm.

This Valentine’s season, we’re asking you to show your love for your neighbors by taking action.

On Wednesday, February 11, SURJ members and partners across the country will take part in Valentine’s Day–themed, nonviolent actions at Target stores to demand that Target break up with ICE — refuse ICE access, stop collaborating, and stop enabling repression in our communities. Our goal is to create a joyful, visible, and disruptive action that calls on Target to take a clear stand against ICE.

This action is rooted in nonviolence, collective care, and solidarity — and you’ll be joining a nationwide movement pushing Target to choose people over oppression.</p>

<h3>CITIZENS BANK: STOP FINANCING ICE PRISONS!</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, March 7, 2026 at 3:30 PM UTC - 4:30 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Sidewalks along Upper Glen Street in front of Citizens Bank and Queensbury Plaza<br>756 Upper Glen St<br>Queensbury, NY 12804</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible ADK/Saratoga</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Citizens Bank publicly presents itself as a community-centered institution committed to social responsibility, yet the bank continues to maintain key financial relationships with CoreCivic and The GEO Group: two notorious, for-profit, prison corporations that support ICE.  

In response, a coalition of progressive organizations has been holding peaceful, coordinated standouts near regional Citizens Bank branches. Our event will be a **Honk-n-Wave**. 🚗👋🏻 Learn more about this movement and view sign examples [in this Substack article.](https://grassrootsconnector.substack.com/p/crawl-walk-run)

**We plan to be out in solidarity with activists across the Northeast who won’t let weather deter them! **Sign Up or check this Mobilize page to be notified of any changes to the event.

**For this action, please keep your signs focused on these messages and use 4-5&quot; high letters for maximum visibility:**
📢Cages Aren’t Communities  
📢De-ICE Citizens Bank  
📢Citizens Bank: Invest in Communities, Not Cages  
📢End Mass Incarceration  
📢Say NO to CoreCivic and The GEO Group  
📢No Banks for Cages  
📢People Over Prison Profits  

**Join *We Rise Saturday* immediately following this event** to bring signs with your other powerful messages. (This is a weekly vigil held from 12-1pm at the Civil War Monument in Glens Falls, just a couple miles down the road.)  

🚗**Parking:** please park in the north end of the Queensbury Plaza shopping center parking lot (corner of Quaker Rd &amp; Route 9/Upper Glen St) *away from the businesses*.  

*A core principle behind all the DE-ICE Citizens Bank events is a **commitment to nonviolent action**. We expect all participants to seek to **de-escalate** any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values and to act lawfully at these events. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events. **Please do not block the bus stop or pedestrian/vehicular traffic.***

&gt; Learn more about Citizens Bank’s relationship to the private prison system:  

&gt; CoreCivic and The GEO Group build and operate immigration detention facilities for ICE, provide transportation services to ICE, and operate prisons for mass incarceration. Go to boycottcitizens.org or contact the De-ICE Coalition at de.ICE.CitizensBank@gmail.com.  

&gt; The coalition calls upon Citizens Bank to live up to its stated values by publicly committing to end its financial relationships with private prison and detention contractors as soon as legally possible. These actions are intended to send a clear message: corporations and financial institutions that enable harmful immigration and detention policies must be held accountable by the communities they claim to serve.

<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Bike Path Crossing on Main Street<br>305 Main St<br>South Kingstown, RI 02879</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Rhode Island</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>The Presidents Day Legacy March: From Statesmen to Stooge is a call for civic accountability and democratic values. Presidents Day honors leadership rooted in service, integrity, and respect for the rule of law. This march asks what kind of leadership we choose to elevate today—and what we are willing to accept.

South County Resistance is holding this event to affirm that democracy requires moral standards and public participation. We will gather at the Bike Path Crossing on Main Street in Wakefield and march together on the sidewalks to Dale Carlia Corner.

This is a family-friendly event. Dress warmly and wear sturdy shoes, as sidewalks may be icy (but not ICE). Participants are encouraged to wear colonial costumes or red, white, and blue, and to bring drums, instruments, noisemakers, flags, signs, or props. We will be giving away 150 pocket U.S. Constitutions.</p>

        <name>National Day of Lobbying: Impeach, Convict, and Remove [Jackson MI] - (MI-05)</name>
        <description><![CDATA[
<h3>National Day of Lobbying: Impeach, Convict, and Remove [Jackson MI] - (MI-05)</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, February 17, 2026 at 2:30 PM UTC - 9:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>401 W Michigan Ave<br>Jackson, MI 49201</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> 50501Missouri</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>In the first week of 2026, the administration engaged in three flagrant abuses of power: (1) an unconstitutional military strike in Venezuela, (2) the extrajudicial murder of Renee Nicole Good by a member of the ICE paramilitary force for exercising her first amendment rights, and (3) the continued obstruction of justice for victims of Jeffrey Epstein’s child sex trafficking ring. A month into 2026, the administration has escalated their unchecked aggression against allies like Greenland and countries like Cuba, Columbia, and Mexico. ICE has kidnapped preschoolers and used them as bait for their parents, and the administration is considering deploying military police to back them up.

In short: It’s not getting better and Congress is not meeting the moment. 

Democracy does not defend itself; it requires the active participation of the people. While countless Americans have already called, emailed, written letters, signed petitions, and while activist organizations have brought groups to Capitol Hill calling for impeachment, this moment demands something more visible, more direct, and more powerful: constituents showing up at congressional district offices, where staff rarely, if ever, engage with constituents.

Impeachment is not optional. It is the remedy mandated by the Constitution.

WHO/WHEN:

FLARE USA, Citizens&apos; Impeachment, and 50501 Movement are proud to announce the next National Day of Action: in-district lobbying on February 17, 2026 for the impeachment, conviction, and removal of President Trump. Representatives will be in their districts; catch them at home and demand they use their power to remove this unconstitutional regime!

<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Join us EVERY Saturday at the Roundabout in Manchester Vermont from noon till 1 pm. Join your neighbors who are tired of the lies from this administration.

Make new friends and join the comrodarary of fellow like minded folks.

Wednesday, January 7th, an American citizen was killed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Minneapolis, Minnesota. This killing is part of a broader pattern of unchecked violence, impunity, and abuse carried out by federal immigration enforcement agencies against members of our communities. 

A broad coalition of groups across the country is calling for a coordinated Ice Out For Good Weekend of Action on Saturday, January 10th and Sunday, January 11th to demand accountability, honor the life lost, and make visible the human cost of ICE’s actions. 

A core principle behind all ICE Out For Good events is a commitment to nonviolent action and no civil disobedience. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values, and to act lawfully at these events. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events. All events should be held in public spaces or on public property.

Indivisible is managing data and communications with participants. By registering, you agree to receive info from Indivisible about the event, receive communications via e-mail or SMS message from Indivisible, and receive any other updates and opportunities to take action or support ICE OUT FOR GOOD partner organizations.

<h3>Multi-state action: Stop Citizens Bank From Financing Private ICE Prisons</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, March 7, 2026 at 5:30 PM UTC - 6:30 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Putney Road<br>Putney Rd<br>Brattleboro, VT 05301</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Where: Putney Road, Brattleboro, VT, near Citizen Bank
URL: https://www.boycottcitizens.org/

Citizens Bank says it&apos;s committed to strengthening communities. BUT as nine other prominent Wall Street banks have ceased financing private prisons, like CoreCIvic and the Geo Group, Citizens Bank has deepened their funding relationship.

Stand up with groups at dozens of Citizen Bank branches across the region to send them a clear message: financing The GEO Group and CoreCIvic is bad for business.

These notorious for-profit prison companies are being called on to be part of an unprecedented expansion in capacity as part of the current administration&apos;s mass detention, deportation, and surveillance policies. They are poised to make huge profits as the system grows. Since 2019, most lenders have cut ties with these two companies due to allegations from forced labor to securities fraud. Not Citizens Bank.

We won&apos;t quietly stand by as Citizens continues to finance the pricvate prision &amp; ICE detention companies that are harming our communities.

The 2019 exodus of banks from the private prision industry in respone to activism should be a reminder to us that our voices matter.

Now it&apos;s time to use them.

Visit https://www.boycottcitizens.org/ for more information.

A core principle behind all Indivisible Brattleboro events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.</p>

        <name>National Day of Lobbying: Impeach, Convict, Remove Warwick, RI (RI-02)</name>
        <description><![CDATA[
<h3>National Day of Lobbying: Impeach, Convict, Remove Warwick, RI (RI-02)</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, February 17, 2026 at 2:15 PM UTC - 3:15 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Congressman Seth Magaziner&apos;s District Office - RI<br>935 Jefferson Blvd<br>Warwick, RI 02886</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Do Something Indivisible SouthCoast NE</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Is Seth Magaziner your Member of Congress (RI-02)? Then this action is for you.

The congressman has agreed to see our group at 9:30am. 

On February 17 at 9:15, Rhode Islanders are coming together to demand real accountability from our representative — not silence, not delay, not political calculations, but leadership.

Join grassroots pro-democracy organizations including 50501 Rhode Island, Rhode Island Action Alliance, Indivisible South Coast New England, and allied community groups as we mobilize for an in-district lobbying action at our Member of Congress&apos;s district office.

We are showing up because what is happening in Washington is not abstract — it is harming real people here at home.

We will share personal stories of how this administration’s actions are impacting our families and communities, and we will demand that our Member of Congress use the full power of his office to:
lead on impeachment and the defunding of ICE by filing articles and forcing votes.

Congress is a co-equal branch of government.
It is time for our representative to act like it.

In just the first weeks of 2026, this administration has committed multiple, flagrant abuses of power, including:
• An unconstitutional military strike in Venezuela
• The extrajudicial killings of individuals by ICE
• Continued obstruction of justice for victims of Jeffrey Epstein’s child sex trafficking ring

Democracy does not defend itself - it requires participation. Americans have called, emailed, signed petitions, and marched. Now this moment demands something more visible and more direct: constituents showing up in person at district offices — where representatives are least insulated from the people they serve.
Impeachment is not optional. It is the constitutional remedy for abuses of power. Defunding and abolishing ICE is not symbolic. It is a legislative action Congress has the authority to take now.
They are not acting because they lack political will.
So we will lend them ours.

*This action is part of the National Day of In-District Lobbying, organized by FLARE USA, Citizens’ Impeachment, and the 50501 Movement. Across the country, constituents will visit the district offices of all 435 U.S. House Representatives to demand the impeachment of President Donald Trump
and the complete defunding and abolishment of ICE.
Representatives will be home in their districts; it&apos;s time to meet them there.

Please see our attendee guide for more information on why we&apos;re mobilizing, specific goals, current news on impeachment, and a full guide, including scripts, for visiting and following up with your Representative&apos;s office at tinyurl.com/lobby217guide.

<h3>National Day of Lobbying: Impeach, Convict, Remove, and Defund ICE Worcester, MA (MA-02)</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, February 17, 2026 at 2:00 PM UTC - 10:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Congressman James P. McGovern&apos;s Office<br>12 E Worcester St suite 1<br>Worcester, MA 01604</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> 50501Missouri</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>## This is NOT a protest or a rally – this is a coordinated day of lobbying. If you would like to participate, we ask that you sign up on Mobilize and/or email outreach@mass50501.org.

[Mass 50501](https://www.mass50501.org/), [Indivisible Mass Coalition](https://indivisible-ma.org/), and multiple organizations from across the state of Massachusetts, in coordination with the 50501 Movement, FLARE USA, &amp; Citizens’ Impeachment, are joining forces for the National Day of Lobbying for impeachment.

Last year, on Presidents’ Day, we rallied to say **No Kings on Presidents’ Day!!** This year, we’re taking that energy directly to our representatives.

On February 17th, 2026, we will hold organized meetings with congressional offices in every district in Massachusetts. We are currently building teams in each district. **If you would like to participate, please RSVP here or email outreach@mass50501.org. We want to be as effective as possible so we are capping each team at 20.** There will be community building events happening following the congressional visit. **Exact meeting time will be communicated once teams are established.**

This is an opportunity to show directly that constituents demand better. We will not be satisfied with empty promises. We want leaders who will honor their oath and [do their job](https://citizensimpeachment.com/all-were-asking-is-for-you-to-do-your-job-congress/): Defending the Constitution by impeaching Donald Trump.

You make this fight possible. And your direct action is more important than ever. Together, we will hold this administration accountable.</p>

        <name>National Day of Lobbying: Impeach, Convict, and Remove Radcliff, KY (KY-02)</name>
        <description><![CDATA[
<h3>National Day of Lobbying: Impeach, Convict, and Remove Radcliff, KY (KY-02)</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, February 17, 2026 at 7:00 PM UTC - 9:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Rep Guthrie’s Hardin County Regional Office<br>411 W Lincoln Trail Blvd<br>Radcliff, KY 40160</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> 50501Missouri</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>In the first week of 2026, the administration engaged in three flagrant abuses of power: (1) an unconstitutional military strike in Venezuela, (2) the extrajudicial murder of Renee Nicole Good by a member of the ICE paramilitary force for exercising her first amendment rights, and (3) the continued obstruction of justice for victims of Jeffrey Epstein’s child sex trafficking ring. A month into 2026, the administration has escalated their unchecked aggression against allies like Greenland and countries like Cuba, Columbia, and Mexico. ICE has kidnapped preschoolers and used them as bait for their parents, and the administration is considering deploying military police to back them up.

In short: It’s not getting better and Congress is not meeting the moment. 

Democracy does not defend itself; it requires the active participation of the people. While countless Americans have already called, emailed, written letters, signed petitions, and while activist organizations have brought groups to Capitol Hill calling for impeachment, this moment demands something more visible, more direct, and more powerful: constituents showing up at congressional district offices, where staff rarely, if ever, engage with constituents.

Impeachment is not optional. It is the remedy mandated by the Constitution.

WHO/WHEN:

FLARE USA, Citizens&apos; Impeachment, and 50501 Movement are proud to announce the next National Day of Action: in-district lobbying on February 17, 2026 for the impeachment, conviction, and removal of President Trump. Representatives will be in their districts; catch them at home and demand they use their power to remove this unconstitutional regime!

Grassroots pro-democracy organizations (e.g., local chapters of Indivisible, Hands Off, 50501), progressive primary candidates, and other concerned citizens will join together in leading constituents into the local/in-district offices of all 435 US House Representatives to demand impeachment. 

Please see our attendee guide for more information on why we&apos;re mobilizing, specific goals, current news on impeachment, and a full guide, including scripts, for visiting and following up with your Representative&apos;s office at tinyurl.com/lobby217guide. 

By registering for the event, you are agreeing that event partners may receive your contact information and communicate with you about related activities. 

All participants are committed to lawful, non-violent action and no civil disobedience.</p>

<h3>National Day of Lobbying: Impeach, Convict, Remove, and Defund ICE New Bedford, MA (MA-09)</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, February 17, 2026 at 6:00 PM UTC - 7:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Congressman Bill Keating&apos;s Office<br>128 Union St suite 103<br>New Bedford, MA 02740</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> 50501Missouri</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>## This is NOT a protest or a rally – this is a coordinated day of lobbying. If you would like to participate, we ask that you sign up on Mobilize and/or email outreach@mass50501.org.

[Mass 50501](https://www.mass50501.org/), [Indivisible Mass Coalition](https://indivisible-ma.org/), and multiple organizations from across the state of Massachusetts, in coordination with the 50501 Movement, FLARE USA, &amp; Citizens’ Impeachment, are joining forces for the National Day of Lobbying for impeachment.

Last year, on Presidents’ Day, we rallied to say **No Kings on Presidents’ Day!!** This year, we’re taking that energy directly to our representatives.

On February 17th, 2026, we will hold organized meetings with congressional offices in every district in Massachusetts. We are currently building teams in each district. **If you would like to participate, please RSVP here or email outreach@mass50501.org. We want to be as effective as possible so we are capping each team at 20.** There will be community building events happening following the congressional visit. **Exact meeting time will be communicated once teams are established.**

This is an opportunity to show directly that constituents demand better. We will not be satisfied with empty promises. We want leaders who will honor their oath and [do their job](https://citizensimpeachment.com/all-were-asking-is-for-you-to-do-your-job-congress/): Defending the Constitution by impeaching Donald Trump.

You make this fight possible. And your direct action is more important than ever. Together, we will hold this administration accountable.</p>

<h3>Citizens Bank Peaceful Standout</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, March 7, 2026 at 3:30 PM UTC - 5:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Baxter Park<br>Massachusetts 27 &amp; Massachusetts 109<br>Medfield, MA 02052</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> MassDems</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>The Medfield Democratic Town Committee is sponsoring a peaceful standout in Medfield on Saturday March 7th from 10:30-12:00. This is being done as part of a group of standouts that will be happening on this day in MA, RI, and VT, organized by the de-ICE Citizens Bank Coalition, which includes the Rhode Island Resistance Coalition and a dozens of local groups affiliated with the Indivisible movement (see indivisible.org and indivisible-ma.org).

We will be peacefully protesting Citizens Bank’s lending financial support to companies building and operating ICE detention centers across the country.

We will gather on Main St, alongside Baxter Park, ACROSS THE STREET from the Medfield Citizens Bank branch (near CVS), so as not to block access to the branch or in any way interfere with customers or employees.

Despite its public commitment to community-centered institutions and social responsibility, and while other major US banks have ended their relationships with the private prison industry, Citizens Bank continues to be a major lender to the country’s two largest private prison companies, CoreCivic and The GEO Group, that build and operate immigration detention centers for ICE. The coalition calls on Citizens Bank to end its financial relationships with private prison and detention contractors as soon as legally possible. For more information about Citizens Bank’s long-standing relationship to the private prison system, go to boycottcitizens.org.

Parking available behind CVS, down Rte 27 in the shopping plaza, or on side streets off of Main St.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
<h3>End ICE Detention at Miami Correctional Facility Rally</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Sunday, February 22, 2026 at 9:00 PM UTC - 11:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Common Ground Midtown Church<br>4550 N Illinois St<br>Indianapolis, IN 46208</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Central Indiana</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>A broad coalition of organizations (listed below) have come together to call on Governor Mike Braun to End ICE Detention at the Miami Correctional Facility. 

Approximately 600 ICE detainees are being held at this prison under terrible conditions. Many ICE detainees are being held unconstitutionally but lack the resources to hire an attorney to represent them in federal court. Over 70% of ICE detainees have no criminal record and over 95% of ICE detainees have never been accused of a violent crime. 

Hoosiers believe in the importance of family. Our state must stop contributing to the unnecessary and cruel separation of families and traumatization of children. 

We will gather at Common Ground Midtown church at 4pm on Sunday, February 22nd. The address is 4550 N. Illinois Street. There will be a short program to center everyone on the meaning and tone of this public witness action. We will then proceed to the Governor&apos;s Mansion, one block east at 46th and N. Meridian Street, with chanting and song at approximately 4:45pm and will remain until 6:00pm. 

If you wish to bring a sign, please keep your signs &quot;family-friendly.&quot; 

Examples include:
&quot;End ICE Detention @ Miami Correctional&quot;  
&quot;Gov. Braun: Do the Right Thing&quot;  
&quot;Love Thy Neighbor&quot;  
&quot;Close the Concentration Camp&quot;  
&quot;Invest in Our Communities Not ICE&quot;  
&quot;Build Affordable Housing Not Concentration Camps&quot;  
&quot;Hoosiers United in Love.&quot; 

Co-Sponsors Include: 
Indiana Conference of the United Methodist Church 
Peace Church Coalition (Quakers, Mennonites, and Church of the Brethren) 
Indiana NETWORK Advocates Team
Indivisible Central Indiana
Fishers Resists
Indiana Undocumented Youth Alliance
Westside Indy Indivisible Resistance Movement

<h3>MI-07 Action: Office Visit</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Thursday, February 12, 2026 at 5:00 PM UTC - 6:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Tom Barrett&apos;s Lansing Office<br>101 S Washington Square suite 520<br>Lansing, MI 48933</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> MoveOn</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>The deaths of Alex Pretti and Renee Good have shaken communities across the country and raised serious concerns about accountability, public safety, and the impact of federal immigration enforcement. People are speaking out against what they view as unchecked violence and lawlessness within ICE and CBP operations and neighbors are coming together to call for transparency, real safety, and care, not fear.

Across the nation, people are taking action against what they see as harmful enforcement practices and demanding that Congress: Vote NO on any new funding for ICE or CBP, End ICE and Border Patrol operations in our communities, especially in sensitive locations like places of worship, schools, and hospitals, and Stop warrantless arrests and enforcement based on racial profiling

Join us for a peaceful Community Honk &amp; Wave. We will also send a delegation up to Barrett&apos;s Office to share our one-pager with him and tell him that we stand together and call for Congress to take that money and invest it where it belongs: in health care, social services, and real public safety.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
<h3>National Day of Lobbying: Impeach, Convict, Remove, and Defund ICE - Lansing, MI (MI-07)</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, February 17, 2026 at 6:00 PM UTC - 7:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Michigan State Capitol<br>100 N Capitol Ave<br>Lansing, MI 48933</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> 50501Missouri</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>*Meet at the capitol building. We will talk to the Attorney General about ICE and then walk to Representative Tim Barnett&apos;s office (four minutes away). 

In the first week of 2026, the administration engaged in three flagrant abuses of power: (1) an unconstitutional military strike in Venezuela, (2) the extrajudicial murder of Renee Nicole Good by a member of the ICE paramilitary force for exercising her first amendment rights, and (3) the continued obstruction of justice for victims of Jeffrey Epstein’s child sex trafficking ring. A month into 2026, the administration has escalated their unchecked aggression against allies like Greenland and countries like Cuba, Columbia, and Mexico. ICE has kidnapped preschoolers and used them as bait for their parents, and the administration is considering deploying military police to back them up.

In short: It’s not getting better and Congress is not meeting the moment. 

Democracy does not defend itself; it requires the active participation of the people. While countless Americans have already called, emailed, written letters, signed petitions, and while activist organizations have brought groups to Capitol Hill calling for impeachment, this moment demands something more visible, more direct, and more powerful: constituents showing up at congressional district offices, where staff rarely, if ever, engage with constituents.

Impeachment is not optional. It is the remedy mandated by the Constitution. Likewise, Congress holds the power to de-fund and abolish ICE. They aren’t acting because they do not have the political will to do so. So we will lend them some of ours.

WHO/WHEN:

FLARE USA, Citizens&apos; Impeachment, and 50501 Movement are proud to announce the next National Day of Action: in-district lobbying on February 17, 2026 for the impeachment of President Trump and the complete abolishment of ICE. Representatives will be in their districts; it&apos;s time to catch them at home. It&apos;s time to Remove the Regime AND abolish ICE!

Grassroots pro-democracy organizations (e.g., local chapters of Indivisible, Hands Off, 50501), progressive primary candidates, and other concerned citizens will join together in leading constituents into the local/in-district offices of all 435 US House Representatives to demand impeachment and the abolishment of ICE. 

Please see our attendee guide for more information on why we&apos;re mobilizing, specific goals, current news on impeachment, and a full guide, including scripts, for visiting and following up with your Representative&apos;s office at tinyurl.com/lobby217guide. 

By registering for the event, you are agreeing that event partners may receive your contact information and communicate with you about related activities. 

All participants are committed to lawful, non-violent action and no civil disobedience.</p>

<h3>National Day of Lobbying: Impeach, Convict, Remove, and Defund ICE Newton, MA (MA-04)</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, February 17, 2026 at 2:00 PM UTC - 10:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Congressman Jake Auchincloss&apos;s Office<br>29 Crafts St suite 375<br>Newton, MA 02458</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> 50501Missouri</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>## This is NOT a protest or a rally – this is a coordinated day of lobbying. If you would like to participate, we ask that you sign up on Mobilize and/or email outreach@mass50501.org.

[Mass 50501](https://www.mass50501.org/), [Indivisible Mass Coalition](https://indivisible-ma.org/), and multiple organizations from across the state of Massachusetts, in coordination with the 50501 Movement, FLARE USA, &amp; Citizens’ Impeachment, are joining forces for the National Day of Lobbying for impeachment.

Last year, on Presidents’ Day, we rallied to say **No Kings on Presidents’ Day!!** This year, we’re taking that energy directly to our representatives.

On February 17th, 2026, we will hold organized meetings with congressional offices in every district in Massachusetts. We are currently building teams in each district. **If you would like to participate, please RSVP here or email outreach@mass50501.org. We want to be as effective as possible so we are capping each team at 20.** There will be community building events happening following the congressional visit. **Exact meeting time will be communicated once teams are established.**

This is an opportunity to show directly that constituents demand better. We will not be satisfied with empty promises. We want leaders who will honor their oath and [do their job](https://citizensimpeachment.com/all-were-asking-is-for-you-to-do-your-job-congress/): Defending the Constitution by impeaching Donald Trump.

You make this fight possible. And your direct action is more important than ever. Together, we will hold this administration accountable.</p>

<h3>Citizens Bank: Stop Financing ICE Prisons</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, March 7, 2026 at 5:00 PM UTC - 6:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Citizens Bank<br>140 Lexington St<br>Burlington, MA 01803</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> De-ICE Citizens Bank Coordinating Committee</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Citizens Bank publicly presents itself as a community-centered institution committed to social responsibility. Yet the bank continues to maintain key financial relationships with CoreCivic and The GEO Group: two notorious, for-profit, prison corporations that build and operate immigration detention facilities for ICE, provide transportation services to ICE, and operate prisons for mass incarceration. For more information about Citizens Bank’s relationship to the private prison system, go to boycottcitizens.org or contact the De-ICE Coalition at de.ICE.CitizensBank@gmail.com.

In response, a coalition of progressive organizations from Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and beyond will hold peaceful, coordinated standouts near regional Citizens Bank branches on Saturday, March 7, 2026. 

An interactive map of participating locations is available here: 
https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1AqRhnn9dpUufZYdnkwFm6cDhqDWM6Tc&amp;ll=41.10651748686255%2C-76.2729175&amp;z=7

Bring your signs: 
Cages Aren’t Communities
De-ICE Citizens Bank
Citizens Bank: Invest in Communities, Not Cages
End Mass Incarceration
Say NO to CoreCivic and The GEO Group
No Banks for Cages
People Over Prison Profits

The coalition calls upon Citizens Bank to live up to its stated values by publicly committing to end its financial relationships with private prison and detention contractors as soon as legally possible. These actions are intended to send a clear message: corporations and financial institutions that enable harmful immigration and detention policies must be held accountable by the communities they claim to serve.

A core principle behind all of these events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values and to act lawfully at these events. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events. Please do not block business entrances or traffic.</p>

First on Jan 24, and now again on March 7, member groups of the De-ICE Citizens Bank Coalition will protest at dozens of Citizen Bank branches all across the northeast to send Citizens a clear message: financing private prison and immigration detention facility operators The GEO Group and CoreCivic is bad for business.

We&apos;ll stand out on the public sidewalks at Citizens Banks with signs and informational leaflets.  We will urge Citizens Bank customers to contact their local branch managers and relevant executives of the Bank about the investments in ICE and that they may be - or will be - closing their accounts. 

Please only bring signs specific to this action, such as: 
Citizens Bank: Stop Financing ICE Prisons! // Cages Aren&apos;t “Communities” // Citizens Bank + ICE = Human Rights Abuse // “Strengthen Our Communities”? Not with ICE Prisons! // Citizens Bank: Cut Ties With ICE.

We&apos;ll have some extra signs.

Dress for the weather. Unless it is unsafe, we plan to be out in solidarity with activists around the country who won&apos;t let weather deter them! Bring hand/foot warmers if you need them. If you Sign Up, you will receive notice of any cancellation.  We will also ask you which branch you will go to.

BACKGROUND.
Citizens Bank publicly presents itself as a community-centered institution committed to social responsibility. Yet the Bank continues to maintain key financial relationships with CoreCivic and The GEO Group, two notorious, for-profit, prison corporations that build and operate immigration detention facilities for ICE, provide transportation services to ICE, and operate prisons for mass incarceration. 

For more details about Citizens Bank’s relationship to the private prison system, go to boycottcitizens.org 

In response, the De-ICE Citizens Bank Coalition (de.ICE.CitizensBank@gmail.com), presently comprising progressive organizations from VA, DC, NJ, PA, NY, RI, CT, MA and VT, will hold coordinated informational standouts near Citizens Bank branches on Saturday, March 7, 2026. 

The Coalition calls upon Citizens Bank to live up to its stated values by publicly committing to end its financial relationships with private prison and detention contractors as soon as legally possible. These actions are intended to send a clear message: corporations and financial institutions that enable harmful immigration and detention policies must be held accountable by the communities they claim to serve.

A core principle behind all of these events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values and to act lawfully at these events. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events. Please do not block business entrances or traffic.</p>

<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>## This is NOT a protest or a rally – this is a coordinated day of lobbying. If you would like to participate, we ask that you sign up on Mobilize and/or email outreach@mass50501.org.

[Mass 50501](https://www.mass50501.org/), [Indivisible Mass Coalition](https://indivisible-ma.org/), and multiple organizations from across the state of Massachusetts, in coordination with the 50501 Movement, FLARE USA, &amp; Citizens’ Impeachment, are joining forces for the National Day of Lobbying for impeachment.

Last year, on Presidents’ Day, we rallied to say **No Kings on Presidents’ Day!!** This year, we’re taking that energy directly to our representatives.

On February 17th, 2026, we will hold organized meetings with congressional offices in every district in Massachusetts. We are currently building teams in each district. **If you would like to participate, please RSVP here or email outreach@mass50501.org. We want to be as effective as possible so we are capping each team at 20.** There will be community building events happening following the congressional visit. **Exact meeting time will be communicated once teams are established.**

This is an opportunity to show directly that constituents demand better. We will not be satisfied with empty promises. We want leaders who will honor their oath and [do their job](https://citizensimpeachment.com/all-were-asking-is-for-you-to-do-your-job-congress/): Defending the Constitution by impeaching Donald Trump.

You make this fight possible. And your direct action is more important than ever. Together, we will hold this administration accountable.</p>

<h3>Ice Out for Good</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 14, 2026 at 3:00 PM UTC - 4:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Gazebo<br>Corner of Main St &amp; Pleasant St.<br>Randolph, VT 05060</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Wednesday, January 7th, an American citizen was killed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Minneapolis, Minnesota. This killing is part of a broader pattern of unchecked violence, impunity, and abuse carried out by federal immigration enforcement agencies against members of our communities. 

A broad coalition of groups across the country coordinated events for Ice Out For Good Weekend of Action on Saturday, January 10th and Sunday, January 11th to demand accountability, honor the life lost, and make visible the human cost of ICE’s actions. We must continue these protests for as long as ICE continues to terrorize our neighborhoods.

A core principle behind all ICE Out For Good events is a commitment to nonviolent action and no civil disobedience. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values, and to act lawfully at these events. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events. All events should be held in public spaces or on public property.

Indivisible is managing data and communications with participants. By registering, you agree to receive info from Indivisible about the event, receive communications via e-mail or SMS message from Indivisible, and receive any other updates and opportunities to take action or support ICE OUT FOR GOOD partner organizations. You also agree to have any data entered in this registration collected by Indivisible. Indivisible will treat your data according to our organization’s applicable privacy policy: https://indivisible.org/privacy-policy

This a local Indivisible event!

<h3>National Day of Lobbying: Impeach, Convict, Remove, and Defund ICE (MA-09, Hyannis)</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, February 17, 2026 at 2:00 PM UTC - 10:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Congressman Bill Keating&apos;s Office<br>259 Stevens St Suite E<br>Hyannis, MA 02601</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> 50501Missouri</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>## This is NOT a protest or a rally – this is a coordinated day of lobbying. If you would like to participate, we ask that you sign up on Mobilize and/or email outreach@mass50501.org.

[Mass 50501](https://www.mass50501.org/), [Indivisible Mass Coalition](https://indivisible-ma.org/), and multiple organizations from across the state of Massachusetts, in coordination with the 50501 Movement, FLARE USA, &amp; Citizens’ Impeachment, are joining forces for the National Day of Lobbying for impeachment.

Last year, on Presidents’ Day, we rallied to say **No Kings on Presidents’ Day!!** This year, we’re taking that energy directly to our representatives.

On February 17th, 2026, we will hold organized meetings with congressional offices in every district in Massachusetts. We are currently building teams in each district. **If you would like to participate, please RSVP here or email outreach@mass50501.org. We want to be as effective as possible so we are capping each team at 20.** There will be community building events happening following the congressional visit. **Exact meeting time will be communicated once teams are established.**

This is an opportunity to show directly that constituents demand better. We will not be satisfied with empty promises. We want leaders who will honor their oath and [do their job](https://citizensimpeachment.com/all-were-asking-is-for-you-to-do-your-job-congress/): Defending the Constitution by impeaching Donald Trump.

You make this fight possible. And your direct action is more important than ever. Together, we will hold this administration accountable.</p>

<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p># Love as Action: Resisting Authoritarianism
## Bearing Witness, Building Hope

### Quaker public witness has stood in opposition to cruel and authoritarian actions in our country before. It is time for us to show this love in action again. 

Please join the American Friends Service Committee to bear witness and show resistance to the authoritarian actions in our country. 

On February 21st at 11AM EST we will gather at Odell Veterans Memorial Park for one hour of public worship and peaceful standout. 

Our hope is that our presence will give hope to all who see us – to show that we can choose resistance - and remind everyone of our moral obligations to one another.

We gather monthly in communities across the country, showing our communities love in action as a public witness of our Quaker values in a time of rising fascism.

Join us! Bring Palestine Flags 🇵🇸 or an Abolish ICE Sign. Bring your friends, your families, your kids, your students, your classmates, your teachers, and anyone else you know as we send a clear message to this administration and congress.

<h3>HANDS OFF GREENLAND 🇬🇱 ICE OUT OF OUR COMMUNITIES [Rally + Standout]</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, March 7, 2026 at 4:00 PM UTC - 5:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Odell Veterans Memorial Park<br>56-98 Broadway<br>Beverly, MA 01915</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Swing Left</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Trump is waging war and committing murder to enrich his billionaire backers. We are fighting to stop him. Stand with us and take action this weekend to demand an end to the occupation of Greenland, Ukraine and our cities.

We’re focusing on corporate targets - companies set to benefit most from the occupation of ICE or Greenland.

We stand united demanding an end to the Greenland occupation and the removal of reckless untrained ICE agents from our communities. And we&apos;re taking our fight to the companies that are backing this administration and benefiting most.

Together we will hit these companies in their pocketbooks, force the administration to end the occupation of Greenland our cities and spread the word to our neighbors that we deserve better.

Every dollar spent in wars overseas or at home is a dollar we paid for with our taxes - a dollar that could and should go to helping our communities thrive. We can have good jobs, better schools, access to healthcare and get our basic needs met. But not while our government works for billionaires and not for us.

Join us, stand strong and speak up.

Please note: A core principle behind all our events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events</p>

<h3>ICE Out For Good + Hands Off Greenland 🇬🇱 [Beverly MA]</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, March 7, 2026 at 4:00 PM UTC - 5:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Odell Veterans Memorial Park<br>56-98 Broadway<br>Beverly, MA 01915</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Wednesday, January 7th, an American citizen was killed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Minneapolis, Minnesota. This killing is part of a broader pattern of unchecked violence, impunity, and abuse carried out by federal immigration enforcement agencies against members of our communities. 

A broad coalition of groups across the country is calling for a coordinated Ice Out For Good Weekend of Action on Saturday, January 10th and Sunday, January 11th to demand accountability, honor the life lost, and make visible the human cost of ICE’s actions. 

A core principle behind all ICE Out For Good events is a commitment to nonviolent action and no civil disobedience. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values, and to act lawfully at these events. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events. All events should be held in public spaces or on public property.

        <name>National Day of Lobbying: Impeach, Convict, and Remove - Bowling Green, KY (KY-02)</name>
        <description><![CDATA[
<h3>National Day of Lobbying: Impeach, Convict, and Remove - Bowling Green, KY (KY-02)</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, February 17, 2026 at 9:30 PM UTC - 11:30 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Brett Guthrie’s Bowling Green Office<br>996 Wilkinson Trace b2<br>Bowling Green, KY 42103</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> 50501Missouri</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>In the first week of 2026, the administration engaged in three flagrant abuses of power: (1) an unconstitutional military strike in Venezuela, (2) the extrajudicial murder of Renee Nicole Good by a member of the ICE paramilitary force for exercising her first amendment rights, and (3) the continued obstruction of justice for victims of Jeffrey Epstein’s child sex trafficking ring. A month into 2026, the administration has escalated their unchecked aggression against allies like Greenland and countries like Cuba, Columbia, and Mexico. ICE has kidnapped preschoolers and used them as bait for their parents, and the administration is considering deploying military police to back them up.

In short: It’s not getting better and Congress is not meeting the moment. 

Democracy does not defend itself; it requires the active participation of the people. While countless Americans have already called, emailed, written letters, signed petitions, and while activist organizations have brought groups to Capitol Hill calling for impeachment, this moment demands something more visible, more direct, and more powerful: constituents showing up at congressional district offices, where staff rarely, if ever, engage with constituents.

Impeachment is not optional. It is the remedy mandated by the Constitution.

WHO/WHEN:

FLARE USA, Citizens&apos; Impeachment, and 50501 Movement are proud to announce the next National Day of Action: in-district lobbying on February 17, 2026 for the impeachment, conviction, and removal of President Trump. Representatives will be in their districts; catch them at home and demand they use their power to remove this unconstitutional regime!

Grassroots pro-democracy organizations (e.g., local chapters of Indivisible, Hands Off, 50501), progressive primary candidates, and other concerned citizens will join together in leading constituents into the local/in-district offices of all 435 US House Representatives to demand impeachment. 

Please see our attendee guide for more information on why we&apos;re mobilizing, specific goals, current news on impeachment, and a full guide, including scripts, for visiting and following up with your Representative&apos;s office at tinyurl.com/lobby217guide. 

By registering for the event, you are agreeing that event partners may receive your contact information and communicate with you about related activities. 

All participants are committed to lawful, non-violent action and no civil disobedience.</p>

        <name>Weekly Protest for an End to ICE in Cherokee County</name>
        <description><![CDATA[
<h3>Weekly Protest for an End to ICE in Cherokee County</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, February 17, 2026 at 9:00 PM UTC - 10:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Intersection of Main Street &amp; Hwy 92<br><br>Woodstock, GA 30188</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Cherokee United</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>**ICE enforcement is expanding in plain sight and in silence.**

Across the country—and here in Georgia—ICE operations rely on racial profiling, secrecy, and fear. People are detained without notice. Families are separated. Children are taken from caregivers. Communities are left in the dark while their neighbors disappear from workplaces, homes, and schools.

**This is not about safety.**

**This is about power exercised without accountability.**

When government agencies operate without transparency, targeting vulnerable people while shielding their actions from public scrutiny, democracy erodes at the local level first. What happens to immigrant communities today becomes the blueprint for broader abuse tomorrow.

That’s why we show up. Every week. Together.

** We gather to demand:** 

• No ICE presence in our neighborhoods

• An end to racial profiling and secret enforcement actions

• Transparency, accountability, and community consent

• Public safety rooted in trust—not fear

———

**📍 Intersection of Hwy 92 &amp; Main St, Woodstock, GA**

**🕓 Every Tuesday • 4–5 PM**

**📣 Indivisible Cherokee United – Activism &amp; Mobilization**

_This is a nonviolent, community-centered protest. We organize peacefully._</p>

<h3>Disappeared in America – ICE Protest</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 14, 2026 at 6:00 PM UTC - 7:30 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>9037 GA-92<br>Woodstock, GA 30189</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Across the country, families are being torn apart while billionaires and corporations cash in. This “Disappeared in America” weekend, we’re joining a national action to expose how Trump’s deportation agenda and corporate greed work hand-in-hand—disappearing our neighbors while the powerful profit.

After our regular Saturday Stand, we’ll gather on the public sidewalk in front of Home Depot to demand an end to MAGA’s regime of bullies-for-the-billionaires. Home Depot’s leadership and political donations have helped bankroll extremist candidates and policies that criminalize immigrants, silence workers, and strip away our freedoms.

We’re standing together—Black, brown, and white, native and newcomer—to say every family belongs, and no corporation should profit from fear.

Bring signs calling out deportations, corporate greed, and the billionaires funding Trump’s takeover.
Example signs:
	•	“Stop the Disappearances”
	•	“No Profits from Pain”
	•	“Home Depot: Fund Communities, Not Fascism”
	•	“Families Belong Together—In Woodstock Too”

Join us to defend our freedoms, our families, and our future.

This a local Indivisible event!

Here is where you&apos;ll describe your local event. Please be specific about important details and include anything a first time attendee, or new group member, might find helpful!

*A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*</p>

<h3>ICE OUT NOW Honk &apos;n&apos; Wave</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 14, 2026 at 4:00 PM UTC - 5:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Intersection of Rt5 and Rt25 at the stoplight<br>515 Waits River Rd<br>Bradford, VT 05033</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>JOIN US to protest against the I.C.E. rampage across U.S. towns and cities!

We’ll have one or two large banners for motorists who drive through this busy intersection at the only stoplight in our region -- help us hold these banners! Please also bring your signs and U.S. flags. The theme is ICE brutality.

We are doing this honk &apos;n&apos; wave EVERY SATURDAY through March 7, maybe longer. ALL HANDS ON DECK for this important peaceful protest.

&quot;Freedom of speech is a principle that supports the freedom of an individual or a community to articulate their opinions and ideas without fear of retaliation, censorship, or legal sanction.&quot; ... One way of helping to ensure we keep our freedom of speech is by exercising it ... regularly.

These Bradford rallies are organized by Corinth/Topsham Indivisible and Third Act Orange East.

*A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*</p>

⏰ 11:30 am—LOOK for Jan’s YELLOW JEEP (in proximity to Allegan City Hall @ 231 Trowbridge St).  

AT THE JEEP: Sign in, pick up your sign, hand-warmers, and a red whistle (in solidarity with Renee Nicole Good to use for Ice sightings). 

⏰ 11:45 am: LINEUP in front of Allegan City Hall for a photo op, receive march instructions, safety tips, and route information.

⏰ NOON: Begin MARCH.

Saturday, February 28th, 11:30 am EST

LOCATION: Allegan City Hall 231 Trowbridge St, Allegan, MI

Please join us in taking a stand against ICE and creating public awareness about the Signs of Fascism happening in the US.

This march is part of Good Trouble Indivisible’s ongoing regional “SIGNS OF FASCISM” and &quot;ICE OUT FOR GOOD&quot; series across West Michigan. This impactful, public awareness march has already taken place three times in Douglas, twice in Saugatuck, in Fennville, Holland, Zeeland, and South Haven — and is now coming to Allegan. Residents are encouraged to join us. (We have combined our ICE OUT FOR GOOD March with our SIGNS OF FASCISM March.)

Good Trouble Indivisible invites you to participate in one of our most powerful nonviolent actions: a silent performance March called SIGNS OF FASCISM will be our first lap through the Allegan downtown area. The second lap of our March through the downtown will represent ICE OUT FOR GOOD.

Participants walk silently, in the first lap of our SIGNS OF FASCISM MARCH, single file, through downtown — dressed in all black — each carrying a stark black-and-white sign naming one warning sign of authoritarianism in America today.

A slow heartbeat drum sets the pace. No chanting. No shouting. No confrontation. Eyes straight ahead. The quiet seriousness of a funeral procession sets the mood and is emulated by the all-black clothing that we all wear.

The second lap, representing ICE OUT FOR GOOD, will duplicate the first lap’s style and demeanor.

All signs are provided at the start of the march. Signs are two-sided. The FASCISM signs are black. The flip side for ICE OUT is white.

This is a peaceful, disciplined visibility action designed to make people pause, reflect, and see what is happening in our country. Our March is known for its impact on public awareness. We intend to both raise public awareness of ICE violence and human rights violations, and the indications of fascism in the Trump administration.

A core principle of all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. Participants are expected to de-escalate any potential confrontation.

Wednesday, January 7th, an American citizen was killed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Minneapolis, Minnesota. This killing is part of a broader pattern of unchecked violence, impunity, and abuse carried out by federal immigration enforcement agencies against members of our communities. 

A broad coalition of groups across the country is calling for a coordinated Ice Out For Good Weekend of Action on Saturday, January 10th and Sunday, January 11th to demand accountability, honor the life lost, and make visible the human cost of ICE’s actions. 

A core principle behind all ICE Out For Good events is a commitment to nonviolent action and no civil disobedience. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values, and to act lawfully at these events. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events. All events should be held in public spaces or on public property.

Indivisible is managing data and communications with participants. By registering, you agree to receive info from Indivisible about the event, receive communications via e-mail or SMS message from Indivisible, and receive any other updates and opportunities to take action or support ICE OUT FOR GOOD partner organizations.

<h3>Congressional District 1 Candidate Forum</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, March 24, 2026 at 10:00 PM UTC - 12:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Otis S. Johnson, Ph.D. Cultural Arts Center<br>201 Montgomery St<br>Savannah, GA 31401</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Savannah Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Meet the Democratic candidates running for Georgia&apos;s 1st Congressional District. You&apos;ll learn about their viewpoints on the issues facing coastal Georgians right now:

- Cuts to healthcare, SNAP, and other benefits
- Destructive tariffs and rising unaffordability
- Attacks on the rights of women and the LGBTQIA+ community
- The unhinged domestic terrorism of ICE
- The climate crisis

And more! Hear where each candidate stands _and_ their proposals for fixing these problems.

With Earl &quot;Buddy&quot; Carter vacating his House of Representatives seat, _now_ is the time to flip this seat blue with a candidate that stands by the people of Georgia instead of another billionaire-first, Trump sycophant.

The program will start at 6 PM and will feature an opportunity for the audience to ask questions.

Parking is available at the Civic Center.</p>

We will also break into teams to organize against the Trump regime and provide a network of mutual support. We will walk out with clear direction and actions for mobilization.

Finally, we’ll celebrate Savannah Indivisible’s first year in action with a potluck and celebratory cake. Feel free to bring a dish if you’d like to share, but no pressure. Come for the community and fellowship.

For this meeting’s mutual aid, we’re collecting personal hygiene products for Parker’s House Women’s Shelter. Here is a list of [recommended items](https://savannahindivisible.org/events/february-2026-group-meeting#:~:text=Personal%20Hygiene%20Products,Tampons%20and%20pads).

Whether you’re new or have been with us from the beginning, your presence matters. Bring your ideas. Bring your open mind. Bring your will to win. It will take all of us.</p>

<h3>Testimony Tuesdays with Faith in Public Life and HRC!</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, February 24, 2026 at 2:00 PM UTC - 5:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Central Presbyterian Church<br>201 Washington St SW<br>Atlanta, GA 30303</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> HRC in Georgia</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Human Rights Campaign and Faith in Public Life Action present Testimony Tuesdays at the Georgia State Capitol. Our days of testimony will be centered around comprehensive reproductive health by uplifting voices of local interfaith leaders and their congregants. Starting at Central Presbyterian Church at 9:00AM, we will go over bills to support and oppose with clear talking points. 

Testimony Tuesdays are a biweekly events led by Faith Leaders and their congregants where they will meet with lawmakers from both parties to press for action on child care access, comprehensive reproductive healthcare, Medicaid expansion, and ICE and immigration protections— issues they say are central to Georgia’s worsening quality-of-life outcomes. As faith leaders expand their roles beyond the pulpit, Testimony Tuesdays reflect a growing movement of clergy and lay faith leaders who are increasing their visibility and influence. From leading community protests to social media training and voter registration drives, they are putting their bodies and beliefs on the frontlines of civic and policy fights that harm their congregants and communities.</p>

<h3>Savannah No ICE! No War!</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Friday, May 1, 2026 at 5:00 PM UTC - 7:30 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Thomas Square Park<br>99 E 35th St<br>Savannah, GA 31404</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> May Day Strong</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Trump is waging war and committing murder to enrich his billionaire backers. We are fighting to stop him. **Stand with us and take action this weekend to demand an end to the occupation of Venezuela and our cities.** 

We’re focusing on corporate targets - companies set to benefit most from the occupation of ICE or Venezuela. 

This week, our target is **Hilton Hotels**, housing this administration&apos;s ICE goons.

**We stand united demanding an end to the Venezuelan occupation and the removal of reckless untrained ICE agents from our communities.** And we&apos;re taking our fight to the companies that are backing this administration and benefiting most.

**Together we will hit these companies in their pocketbooks, force the administration to end the occupation of Venezuela and our cities and spread the word to our neighbors that we deserve better.**

Every dollar spent in wars overseas or at home is a dollar we paid for with our taxes - a dollar that could and should go to helping our communities thrive. We can have good jobs, better schools, access to healthcare and get our basic needs met. But not while our government works for billionaires and not for us.

Join us, stand strong and speak up.

*Please note: A core principle behind all our events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events*</p>

<h3>Ice out of Our Schools!</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Sunday, February 22, 2026 at 8:30 PM UTC - 10:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>American Friends Services Committee (AFSC)<br>711 Catherine St SW<br>Atlanta, GA 30310</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Working Families Party</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Join the WFPeaches and Raising Comrades for a training and discussion about how kids and families can support our kids and the immigrant communities in their schools and day cares. 

### Event details
Calling all parents, caregivers, and allies of children heartbroken by ICE harming our communities! Are you struggling to talk as a family about ICE? Or maybe you have vulnerable members in your school or community that you’re looking to support. Are you equipped with a plan if ICE comes to your school or day care facility?
 
Join us at 3:30 p.m. on Feb. 22, as we spend an afternoon addressing these topics and more. This will be a safe space for parents, kids, and community members to discuss concerns, ask questions, and learn how to take action. You will walk away with tools to start organizing within your school or day care community. 

Location details will be sent prior to the event.

### Will childcare be provided?
Bring the kids along! This training is intended for all ages, so child care will not be present. We kindly ask all attendees to participate to the extent they can, taking breaks when needed.

### About Raising Comrades
Raising Comrades is an Atlanta-based anti-capitalist collective of caregivers supporting children and one another in nonviolent resistance. Formed in 2024, they are made up of parents, guardians, aunties, babysitters, educators and, most importantly, kids. They plan together and protest together—including hosting know-your-rights and street medic trainings, developing checklists and curricula for child-friendly protests and rallies, and providing childcare for grown-ups desiring to attend riskier actions.</p>

<h3>ICE out for Good!  Civil Rights Sundays</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Sunday, February 15, 2026 at 2:30 PM UTC - 2:45 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Market Square<br>Portsmouth, NH 03801</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Last week, over 1,200 people came out to protest the Murder of Renee Good, with ICE out for Good! and all that is going on! The fascist takeover of our country. The disregard for our Constitution and our laws.
The Murder of Renee Good, despite the attempts to obfuscate, boils down to the fact that nothing she did deserved a death sentence, and ICE was acting as Judge, Jury, and Executioner. Not just Jonothan Ross, but we have seen similar disregard for the law across the country.
Venezuela is still going on, as is the immigration crackdown, and now we have to worry about Iran and attacking our NATO partner, Greenland.
✔ Oppose U.S. war/militarism
✔ Reject regime change and sovereignty violations
✔ Call for peace and respect for international law
Join us at 3! Civil Rights Sundays!
Say No to the military being used against Citizens!
Due Process is being denied to immigrants; it is only a matter of time before it is taken from citizens!

Join us today to save our Democracy!

Build a Democracy that Money Can&apos;t Buy!
Stand up for Democracy!
Stand up for Our Country!
Stand up for Immigrants!
Stand up for History!
Stand up for Equity!

and on and on and on....
The Hand&apos;s Off and NO KINGS Rallies were awesome but we need to continue!
We stand along the street in front of the North Church, On Congress Street! the Brick Church off of Market Square in Portsmouth!
Everyone is welcome to bring their own signs, We also have signs, banners, and flags to share.
We call the event Civil Rights Sundays, we started in November of 2016 after Trump won the first time, and we were in the square every Sunday until Covid shut us down, then we went back out when Ukraine was invaded and brought back the name Civil Rights Sundays when Roe Vs Wade was overturned.
Please join us at 3 PM!
Call for a continued ceasefire in Gaza and for an end to our administration using our tax dollars to support a holocaust!

Good Trouble Indivisible&apos;s

ICE OUT: Community Think-Tank is an open, inclusive space for community members to come together to talk, listen, and think critically about what is happening with ICE and immigration enforcement in our cities.

This gathering is not a protest or a lecture. It is a facilitated community conversation designed to:

	•	Share thoughts, concerns, and lived experiences

	•	Discuss the real impacts of ICE activity on families and communities

	•	Brainstorm ideas, actions, and solutions focused on getting ICE out of our cities

	•	Build understanding, solidarity, and community-driven strategies for change

While broader concerns about the current Trump administration and its policies may arise naturally, this Think-Tank will remain intentionally focused on ICE—its role, its impact, and what meaningful community resistance and alternatives can look like.

All are welcome. No prior knowledge or political affiliation is required.
Respectful dialogue and shared humanity are the foundation of this space.

Hosted by: Good Trouble Indivisible
Accessibility: Indoor, seated, warm, and community-centered

This a local Indivisible event!

*A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*</p>

<h3>ICE OUT: COMMUNITY VIGIL | Saugatuck</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Sunday, February 15, 2026 at 10:30 PM UTC - 11:30 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>All Saints Episcapol Church<br>252 Grand St<br>Saugatuck, MI 49453</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>ICE OUT COMMUNITY VIGIL – A Space for Witness, Grief, and Collective Voice

Host Organization:
Good Trouble Indivisible (with community partners)

📍All Saints Episcopal Church (Sanctuary – indoors)
     252 Grand St, Saugatuck, MI 49453

📆 Every Sunday Evening 

⏰ 5:30 PM – 6:30 PM | Please allow additional time for a quiet, respectful departure by 7:00 PM.

Event Description:
This is a community-led ICE OUT vigil, held inside the sanctuary of All Saints Episcopal Church—created as a space for reflection, shared grief, witness, and collective care.

This gathering is non-partisan and open to all. People of all backgrounds, beliefs, and political affiliations are welcome. The focus of this vigil is humanitarian, moral, and grounded in shared human dignity.

There will be no featured speakers and no formal program. Instead, the vigil centers the voices of those who attend. Community members are invited—if they choose—to stand and speak from the pulpit or from their seats, sharing how they feel about ICE enforcement practices, including detention, deportation, family separation, brutality, and loss of life.

This is a space to:

	•	Speak names

	•	Speak truth

	•	Bear witness together

	•	Sit with one another in reflection and care

A light facilitation will help maintain a respectful, grounded flow, but the vigil itself belongs to the community.

What to Expect:

	•	Indoor, seated vigil

	•	Quiet, respectful atmosphere

	•	Community sharing (voluntary)

	•	No microphones or amplification

	•	No chanting or movement outside the sanctuary

What This Is / Is Not:

	✔ A vigil, ✖ not a protest

	✔ Non-partisan and community-centered

	✔ Open and welcoming to all

	✔ A space for moral witness and shared humanity

	✖ Not a rally or planning meeting

All are welcome who come in the spirit of respect, reflection, and care for one another.

<h3>National Day of Lobbying: Impeach, Convict, and Remove Madisonville - Madisonville, KY (KY-02)</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, February 17, 2026 at 8:00 PM UTC - 12:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>67 N Main St<br>Madisonville, KY 42431</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> 50501Missouri</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>In the first week of 2026, the administration engaged in three flagrant abuses of power: (1) an unconstitutional military strike in Venezuela, (2) the extrajudicial murder of Renee Nicole Good by a member of the ICE paramilitary force for exercising her first amendment rights, and (3) the continued obstruction of justice for victims of Jeffrey Epstein’s child sex trafficking ring. A month into 2026, the administration has escalated their unchecked aggression against allies like Greenland and countries like Cuba, Columbia, and Mexico. ICE has kidnapped preschoolers and used them as bait for their parents, and the administration is considering deploying military police to back them up.

In short: It’s not getting better and Congress is not meeting the moment. 

Democracy does not defend itself; it requires the active participation of the people. While countless Americans have already called, emailed, written letters, signed petitions, and while activist organizations have brought groups to Capitol Hill calling for impeachment, this moment demands something more visible, more direct, and more powerful: constituents showing up at congressional district offices, where staff rarely, if ever, engage with constituents.

Impeachment is not optional. It is the remedy mandated by the Constitution.

WHO/WHEN:

FLARE USA, Citizens&apos; Impeachment, and 50501 Movement are proud to announce the next National Day of Action: in-district lobbying on February 17, 2026 for the impeachment, conviction, and removal of President Trump. Representatives will be in their districts; catch them at home and demand they use their power to remove this unconstitutional regime!

Grassroots pro-democracy organizations (e.g., local chapters of Indivisible, Hands Off, 50501), progressive primary candidates, and other concerned citizens will join together in leading constituents into the local/in-district offices of all 435 US House Representatives to demand impeachment. 

Please see our attendee guide for more information on why we&apos;re mobilizing, specific goals, current news on impeachment, and a full guide, including scripts, for visiting and following up with your Representative&apos;s office at tinyurl.com/lobby217guide. 

By registering for the event, you are agreeing that event partners may receive your contact information and communicate with you about related activities. 

All participants are committed to lawful, non-violent action and no civil disobedience.</p>

<h3>National Day of Lobbying: Impeach, Convict, Remove, and Defund ICE - Huntsville, AL (AL-05)</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, February 17, 2026 at 10:00 PM UTC - 11:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Dale Strong&apos;s Huntsville District Office<br>2101 Clinton Ave W<br>Huntsville, AL 35805</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> 50501Missouri</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Join and support a delegation of citizens of Huntsville as we present our demands that Congressman Strong supports impeachment of Trump, the criminals in his administration and removing funding from the Paramilitary known as ICE. 

4pm - 5:30 pm
Dale Strong&apos;s Huntsville Office
Demonstrate for Impeachment and the Death of Liberty and Justice at the hands of this government. 
Funeral Attire Encouraged. 

In the first week of 2026, the administration engaged in three flagrant abuses of power: (1) an unconstitutional military strike in Venezuela, (2) the extrajudicial murder of Renee Nicole Good by a member of the ICE paramilitary force for exercising her first amendment rights, and (3) the continued obstruction of justice for victims of Jeffrey Epstein’s child sex trafficking ring. A month into 2026, the administration has escalated their unchecked aggression against allies like Greenland and countries like Cuba, Columbia, and Mexico. ICE has kidnapped preschoolers and used them as bait for their parents, and the administration is considering deploying military police to back them up.

In short: It’s not getting better and Congress is not meeting the moment. 

Democracy does not defend itself; it requires the active participation of the people. While countless Americans have already called, emailed, written letters, signed petitions, and while activist organizations have brought groups to Capitol Hill calling for impeachment, this moment demands something more visible, more direct, and more powerful: constituents showing up at congressional district offices, where staff rarely, if ever, engage with constituents.

Impeachment is not optional. It is the remedy mandated by the Constitution. Likewise, Congress holds the power to de-fund and abolish ICE. They aren’t acting because they do not have the political will to do so. So we will lend them some of ours.

WHO/WHEN:

FLARE USA, Citizens&apos; Impeachment, and 50501 Movement are proud to announce the next National Day of Action: in-district lobbying on February 17, 2026 for the impeachment of President Trump and the complete abolishment of ICE. Representatives will be in their districts; it&apos;s time to catch them at home. It&apos;s time to Remove the Regime AND abolish ICE!

Grassroots pro-democracy organizations (e.g., local chapters of Indivisible, Hands Off, 50501), progressive primary candidates, and other concerned citizens will join together in leading constituents into the local/in-district offices of all 435 US House Representatives to demand impeachment and the abolishment of ICE.

<h3>No ICE No War</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Friday, May 1, 2026 at 4:00 PM UTC - 6:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Presque Isle County District Court<br>151 E Huron Ave<br>Rogers City, MI 49779</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> May Day Strong</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Trump is waging war and committing murder to enrich his billionaire backers. We are fighting to stop him. **Stand with us and take action this weekend to demand an end to the occupation of Venezuela and our cities.** 

We’re focusing on corporate targets - companies set to benefit most from the occupation of ICE or Venezuela. 

This week, our target is **Hilton Hotels**, housing this administration&apos;s ICE goons.

**We stand united demanding an end to the Venezuelan occupation and the removal of reckless untrained ICE agents from our communities.** And we&apos;re taking our fight to the companies that are backing this administration and benefiting most.

**Together we will hit these companies in their pocketbooks, force the administration to end the occupation of Venezuela and our cities and spread the word to our neighbors that we deserve better.**

Every dollar spent in wars overseas or at home is a dollar we paid for with our taxes - a dollar that could and should go to helping our communities thrive. We can have good jobs, better schools, access to healthcare and get our basic needs met. But not while our government works for billionaires and not for us.

Join us, stand strong and speak up.

*Please note: A core principle behind all our events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events*</p>

<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Treetops Resort<br>3962 Wilkinson Rd<br>Gaylord, MI 49735</p>

One year after the devastating March 2025 ice storms, families, farmers, and small business owners are still navigating a long road to recovery—from repairing property and rebuilding livelihoods to preparing for future extreme weather storms. 

This People’s Hearing creates space for Northern Michigan residents to share what they lived through and speak directly with elected officials about what their communities need moving forward.

The event is designed as a community gathering, with time to connect with neighbors, Michigan-based nonprofit organizations, and local leaders. Food and drinks will be available. Members of the press will be in attendance to help elevate community voices and stories beyond the room.</p>

<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>This a local Indivisible event!

On February 21, 1958 the Peace sign ☮️was designed by Gerald Holtom. Sixty-eight years later, South Suburban Relentless will hold it&apos;s Peaceful Protest on 2/21/26. 14700 LaGrange Road. Orland Park, IL. from 11am until 1pm. Some of the rules need to be gone over. if you invite friends please share the rules with them. NO engagement with counter protesters. Turn way from them and face the street. If they ask you to show them your sign, don&apos;t. Monitors are always on site. If you  have a whistle, use it once or twice to get a Monitors attention. Keep at least 2 feet away from the curb. Do not go into the median to take pictures. Please be civil with your signs. We want to respect the community and there are children everywhere. This is not censorship, it is our approach to having our voices heard. The counter protesters signs are vulgar and filled with profanity. You do not want to be mistaken for one of them. We have a huge Sign/Flag Library that we welcome you to borrow from. Verda&apos;s Food Drive will be open. We sincerely appreciate your generosity. If you are struggling with food insecurity, see one of our Monitors and we&apos;ll sort that out. Ice Out! He&apos;s in the epstein files! When injustice becomes law, RESISTANCE becomes DUTY!

<h3>Be Pretti Good in Calhoun County</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 14, 2026 at 5:00 PM UTC - 7:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>812 Noble St<br>Anniston, AL 36201</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Wednesday, January 7th, an American citizen was killed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Then on January 24th, Alex Pretti was shot multiple times as Border Patrol officers tried to arrest him for recording immigration officers on his phone as they pushed women to the ground. These killings are part of a broader pattern of unchecked violence, impunity, and abuse carried out by federal immigration enforcement agencies against members of our communities. 

We will gather on February 14th, in the form of a &apos;Human Billboard&apos; lined along Quintard Avenue, to demand accountability, honor the lives lost, and make visible the human cost of ICE’s actions. 

A core principle behind all ICE Out For Good events is a commitment to nonviolent action and no civil disobedience. All participants are expected to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values, and to act lawfully at these events. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events.</p>

<h3>Say Something! Do Something!</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 21, 2026 at 7:00 PM UTC - 9:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>International Servant Leaders Museum<br>9233 Shermer Rd<br>Morton Grove, IL 60053</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Niles Maine Township</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>On the birthday of John Lewis, we gather in the spirit of good trouble—the disciplined, nonviolent pursuit of justice rooted in conscience, service, and respect for the rule of law. Hosted by the International Servant Leaders Museum in association with  Indivisible Niles Maine Township,  this educational program reflects the core principles of servant leadership and a clear commitment to legal rights, constitutional protections, and lawful civic engagement.

The Reverend Dr. Michael Woolf will reflect on his civil rights protest experiences at the Broadview ICE facility, offering firsthand insight into faith-guided, nonviolent action that seeks accountability while honoring due process. This presentation will be followed by an informative presentation by Sanctuary Niles Township about how to protect our communities through local advocacy efforts, mutual aid and worker solidarity. The event will end with an opportunity for informal chats with the speakers, and representatives of several local Indivisible chapters.

Together, this program honors the legacy of John Lewis by translating moral courage into informed action—cultivating servant leaders who uphold human dignity, strengthen community trust, and work within the law to advance justice for all.</p>

<h3>[Your City Citgo/Chevron] No Occupation of Venezuela, No Occupation of Our Cities</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Friday, May 1, 2026 at 9:00 PM UTC - 1:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Blackshear<br>Gordon St/ Highway 84<br>Blackshear, GA 31516</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> May Day Strong</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Don’t stand on the sidelines while Trump spills blood on behalf of the billionaire class while they jack up the prices for rent, healthcare and groceries . **Stand with us and take action.** 

We know the bombs over Venezuela and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem’s untrained ICE militia in our cities are about billionaires making themselves richer no matter the human cost. **We stand united demanding an end to the Venezuelan occupation and the removal of reckless untrained ICE agents from our communities. **

Every dollar spent in wars overseas or at home is a dollar we paid for with our taxes - a dollar that could and should go to helping our communities thrive. **We can have good jobs, better schools, access to healthcare and get our basic needs met. But not while our government works for billionaires and not for us.**

Join us, stand strong and speak up. 

*Please note: A core principle behind all our events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events*</p>

<h3>Whistle Kit/Senate Debate Watch Party - Elk Grove Village, Illinois</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Friday, February 20, 2026 at 12:30 AM UTC - 2:30 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Real Time Sports Bar &amp; Grill<br>1120 W Devon Ave<br>Elk Grove Village, IL 60007</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Elk Grove Township</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>**Join Indivisible Elk Grove Township in blowing the whistle on ICE!**

Whistle Kit making parties are a community safety practice rooted in resistance movements to help alert neighbors during immigration raids.

In moments like these, we’re reminded that protection is not just a policy, it’s a community responsibility.

Make new friends, watch the U.S. Senate debate, and discuss local and national issues, all while saving democracy by making Whistle Kits **TOGETHER**!

We will provide all you&apos;ll need, including zines, Know Your Rights cards, and whistle kit supplies! We ask that you take kits home with you to distribute to local business, neighbors, and anyone who is in this fight with us. Bring yourself, and perhaps a few friends! 

Real Time Sports Bar &amp; Grill is graciously allowing us to use their location, so  we ask that you please purchase food and beverages while you&apos;re here. Everyone will receive their own individual tab. Please tip your server!</p>

<h3>ICE Out For Good Murray, Ky</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Sunday, February 15, 2026 at 8:00 PM UTC - 10:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Kentucky 121 &amp; North 12th Street<br>Murray, KY 42071</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Wednesday, January 7th, an American citizen was killed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Minneapolis, Minnesota. This killing is part of a broader pattern of unchecked violence, impunity, and abuse carried out by federal immigration enforcement agencies against members of our communities. 

A broad coalition of groups across the country is calling for a coordinated Ice Out For Good Weekend of Action on Saturday, January 10th and Sunday, January 11th to demand accountability, honor the life lost, and make visible the human cost of ICE’s actions. 

A core principle behind all ICE Out For Good events is a commitment to nonviolent action and no civil disobedience. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values, and to act lawfully at these events. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events. All events should be held in public spaces or on public property.

Indivisible is managing data and communications with participants. By registering, you agree to receive info from Indivisible about the event, receive communications via e-mail or SMS message from Indivisible, and receive any other updates and opportunities to take action or support ICE OUT FOR GOOD partner organizations. You also agree to have any data entered in this registration collected by Indivisible. Indivisible will treat your data according to our organization’s applicable privacy policy: https://indivisible.org/privacy-policy</p>

        <name>National Day of Lobbying: Impeach, Convict, Remove, and Defund ICE - Kane County, IL (IL-11)</name>
        <description><![CDATA[
<h3>National Day of Lobbying: Impeach, Convict, Remove, and Defund ICE - Kane County, IL (IL-11)</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, February 17, 2026 at 4:00 PM UTC - 6:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>2000 W Galena Blvd Suite 303<br>Aurora, IL 60506</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> 50501Missouri</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>We will be protesting at Bill Foster’s office, 2/17/2026, 10am-12pm, and we will leave written statements with his staff. In the first week of 2026, the administration engaged in three flagrant abuses of power: (1) an unconstitutional military strike in Venezuela, (2) the extrajudicial murder of Renee Nicole Good by a member of the ICE paramilitary force for exercising her first amendment rights, and (3) the continued obstruction of justice for victims of Jeffrey Epstein’s child sex trafficking ring. A month into 2026, the administration has escalated their unchecked aggression against allies like Greenland and countries like Cuba, Columbia, and Mexico. ICE has kidnapped preschoolers and used them as bait for their parents, and the administration is considering deploying military police to back them up.

In short: It’s not getting better and Congress is not meeting the moment. 

Democracy does not defend itself; it requires the active participation of the people. While countless Americans have already called, emailed, written letters, signed petitions, and while activist organizations have brought groups to Capitol Hill calling for impeachment, this moment demands something more visible, more direct, and more powerful: constituents showing up at congressional district offices, where staff rarely, if ever, engage with constituents.

Impeachment is not optional. It is the remedy mandated by the Constitution. Likewise, Congress holds the power to de-fund and abolish ICE. They aren’t acting because they do not have the political will to do so. So we will lend them some of ours.

WHO/WHEN:

FLARE USA, Citizens&apos; Impeachment, and 50501 Movement are proud to announce the next National Day of Action: in-district lobbying on February 17, 2026 for the impeachment of President Trump and the complete abolishment of ICE. Representatives will be in their districts; it&apos;s time to catch them at home. It&apos;s time to Remove the Regime AND abolish ICE!

Grassroots pro-democracy organizations (e.g., local chapters of Indivisible, Hands Off, 50501), progressive primary candidates, and other concerned citizens will join together in leading constituents into the local/in-district offices of all 435 US House Representatives to demand impeachment and the abolishment of ICE. 

Please see our attendee guide for more information on why we&apos;re mobilizing, specific goals, current news on impeachment, and a full guide, including scripts, for visiting and following up with your Representative&apos;s office at tinyurl.com/lobby217guide. 

By registering for the event, you are agreeing that event partners may receive your contact information and communicate with you about related activities. 

All participants are committed to lawful, non-violent action and no civil disobedience.</p>

        <name>National Day of Lobbying: Impeach, Convict, Remove, and Defund ICE - Bost&apos;s Mascoutah Office (IL-12)</name>
        <description><![CDATA[
<h3>National Day of Lobbying: Impeach, Convict, Remove, and Defund ICE - Bost&apos;s Mascoutah Office (IL-12)</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, February 17, 2026 at 4:00 PM UTC - 6:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>205 E Harnett St<br>Mascoutah, IL 62258</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> 50501Missouri</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>We will be protesting at Bost&apos;s Mascoutah office, 2/17/2026, 10am-12pm, and we will leave written statements with his staff.

In the first week of 2026, the administration engaged in three flagrant abuses of power: (1) an unconstitutional military strike in Venezuela, (2) the extrajudicial murder of Renee Nicole Good by a member of the ICE paramilitary force for exercising her first amendment rights, and (3) the continued obstruction of justice for victims of Jeffrey Epstein’s child sex trafficking ring. A month into 2026, the administration has escalated their unchecked aggression against allies like Greenland and countries like Cuba, Columbia, and Mexico. ICE has kidnapped preschoolers and used them as bait for their parents, and the administration is considering deploying military police to back them up.

In short: It’s not getting better and Congress is not meeting the moment. 

Democracy does not defend itself; it requires the active participation of the people. While countless Americans have already called, emailed, written letters, signed petitions, and while activist organizations have brought groups to Capitol Hill calling for impeachment, this moment demands something more visible, more direct, and more powerful: constituents showing up at congressional district offices, where staff rarely, if ever, engage with constituents.

Impeachment is not optional. It is the remedy mandated by the Constitution. Likewise, Congress holds the power to de-fund and abolish ICE. They aren’t acting because they do not have the political will to do so. So we will lend them some of ours.

WHO/WHEN:

FLARE USA, Citizens&apos; Impeachment, and 50501 Movement are proud to announce the next National Day of Action: in-district lobbying on February 17, 2026 for the impeachment of President Trump and the complete abolishment of ICE. Representatives will be in their districts; it&apos;s time to catch them at home. It&apos;s time to Remove the Regime AND abolish ICE!

Grassroots pro-democracy organizations (e.g., local chapters of Indivisible, Hands Off, 50501), progressive primary candidates, and other concerned citizens will join together in leading constituents into the local/in-district offices of all 435 US House Representatives to demand impeachment and the abolishment of ICE. 

Please see our attendee guide for more information on why we&apos;re mobilizing, specific goals, current news on impeachment, and a full guide, including scripts, for visiting and following up with your Representative&apos;s office at tinyurl.com/lobby217guide. 

By registering for the event, you are agreeing that event partners may receive your contact information and communicate with you about related activities. 

All participants are committed to lawful, non-violent action and no civil disobedience.</p>

Let’s come together in Stoughton to peacefully declare that the actions of this administration are not acceptable as we say: “NOT our President!” From ICE to the economy, from the assault on our Constitution to the never-ending lies…make your sign and considering stringing lights around it. We’ll hold a peaceful, stationary rally (safer at dusk!) from 5:30-6:30 on Main St. in front of the public library (304 S. Fourth St.) followed by a gathering at The Old Firehouse Lounge (364 East Main St.) with light appetizers and a cash bar. Want to learn to be a Peace Keeper at our rallies? Come and learn what more we can be doing to make a difference.

This a local Indivisible event!

<h3>National Day of Lobbying: Impeach, Convict, Remove, and Defund ICE [ ST LOUIS</h3>

National Day of Action – February 17, 2026

They’ll be home in their districts. We’re meeting them there.

FLARE USA, Citizens’ Impeachment, and the 50501 Movement are organizing coordinated, in-district office visits across all 435 House districts to demand:

Impeachment of President Trump

Defunding and abolishing ICE

Constituents will show up directly at district offices to insist Congress use its constitutional authority.

Why Now

In the first weeks of 2026, the administration has escalated what many see as unconstitutional military aggression abroad and deadly, abusive ICE enforcement at home. Congress has not acted with the urgency this moment demands.

Democracy requires pressure.
Calls and petitions matter — but in-person constituent presence is harder to ignore.

Impeachment is a constitutional remedy. Congress also controls federal funding — including ICE. If they lack political will, we will provide it.

All participants are committed to lawful, non-violent engagement.</p>

<h3>Presentation: “Immigration: How we got here, a better path forward&quot;</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Friday, February 13, 2026 at 12:00 AM UTC - 1:30 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Winnebago County Democratic Party Office<br>480 N Main St.<br>Oshkosh, WI 54901</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>We will see migration across the southern border and resources devoted to border security since 1990. This Customs and Border Protection data challenges much of the current public narrative.  Next we focus on individual asylum seekers Kat has known and worked with, their stories putting a human face on the numbers and the conditions in some major sending countries, as well as some of their experiences with ICE. The next section describes immigration and border policies of 2024-25, including ICE agreements with local law enforcement and resources devoted to immigration enforcement. The last section addresses the incentives and realities that drive migrant decision-making, and explores how we might create a better national conversation about immigration.

Now is the time for even more people to raise their voices and be visible in their resistance.Politicians do take notice of these, large peaceful, non-violent protests. The Trump administration is lashing out even more with ICE aggression and voter suppression because they know they are losing their support. 

Help us double the number of people we will gather in Houdini Plaza and along College avenue on March 28 3 pm to 5pm. Raise your voice, show your signs of outrage,  hear some speakers, join in chants, enjoy the enthusiasm of like-minded people .It will be loud.  It will be fun.  

This protest is supported by many local organizations. Look for their announcements and ours of many events leading to this momentous rally. 
Fox Valley Indivisible, Forward Fox Valley(Indivisible), Hate Free Outagamie, National Organization of Women (NOW), League of Women Voters, Outagamie Dems, NEW Resist.

Saturday, February 14. 10:00 – 11:00. Nichols Road and Monona Drive.

Also February 28.

We the People Are Pissed! Resistance is growing. 

Protests are growing. The Giant is rising. Peacefully, non-violently, but with determination.

We the People are the Giant.  We are not going away.

More and more people across the country are telling the Trump regime that they don’t like what is happening to  the country. 

We don’t like ICE in our communities. We want ICE reined in. 

We really don’t like seeing families and communities ripped apart by anonymous masked ICE agents violently shooting, killing, arresting and detaining US citizens and immigrants with no criminal records. 

We are pissed that this authoritarian regime threatens to unilaterally take possession of Greenland, undermining NATO and our European allies. 

We are pissed that the regime uses overt, blatant, active racism to attack and divide us.

People  are tired of cruelty, and  lies, and chaos. This is no way to govern.

We are tired of the attacks on the rule of law.

People know that this is not what the United States is. Our laws, customs, values, and traditions are being ripped apart.  We object. We want No Kings!

When we protest, it gives others  courage to join us. They know they are not alone.

Join us! In Honor of Renee Good and Alex Pretti

<p><strong>When:</strong> Sunday, February 15, 2026 at 4:00 PM UTC - 6:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>3077 E Wash Av Frontage Rd<br>Madison, WI 53714</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> WisDems</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Meet us on Madison&apos;s East Side to Protest the Trump Administration.

This administration has deployed their secret police to our streets to abduct our neighbors and drive fear into the populace. We will not stand for ICE terrorizing our communities and murdering protesters. We demand an end to the terror and justice for all harmed. 

Trump&apos;s assault on Venezuela is an extreme abuse of power that cannot be tolerated. His actions could destabilize South America and cause widespread immiseration in the Western Hemisphere. How dare he do this in our name! We say, No! NO ICE! No war for oil! No to colonialism! We demand Peace among nations, peace in our communities, and the restoration of sanity.

We will be on the Starkweather Creek Path pedestrian bridge over East Washington Ave.  Please park on E Wash Av Frontage Rd at the dead end. It&apos;s an easy walk from there to the bridge. This is a non-violent protest. Bring your big signs and flags.</p>

<h3>Standing Against Children and Families in ICE Detention Centers</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Friday, February 13, 2026 at 8:00 PM UTC - 10:15 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Fortunato Park<br>2 John Anderson Dr<br>Ormond Beach, FL 32176</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Amnesty International, Sea Grape Chapter</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>As ICE and Border Patrol go on a mad scramble to aquire enormous warehouses, the accounts are becoming more concerning by the day. 
Children are literally being taken out of schools by ICE. Families are being taken from Emergency Rooms. Sleeping children and their moms and dads are being taken from their beds in pre-dawn raids which involved masked men with big guns, drones, shock grenades, and sometimes chemical weapons. People are being dragged from their beds and bathrooms, oftentimes undressed, without dignity or humanity. 

And where they&apos;re being taken are concentration camps. In some of them, children are held in enormous wards exclusively comprised of children. In others, such as Dilley in Texas, entire families are imprisoned together.  

Nurse accounts, back when medical care was provided at the camps, described hundreds of crying children in shock and staff who were gruff and blank. 
Accounts have described molded and worm- infested food, metallic emergency blankets, inadequate clothing, inadequate access to water or toilets, backed up toilets, lack of personal care items such as toothbrushes, toothpaste, soap, brushes, feminine hygiene products, diapers, and lack of medical care. 
In addition, Families and children can be held in these facilities from weeks to months, and even years. In this time, education stops. Religious instruction stops. So do all recreational and social activities that keep children engaged and thriving. Friends are lost and extended family bonds are cut. 

ICE detention is torture of innocent children, and cruelty IS the point, according to this administration. So we will protest again.

An important note: 
We are in the South. We are going to encounter all kinds and many people who will want to engage in agitation. 
We are a movement of nonviolence and deescalation. We do not shout at cars across the street or give the finger back or &apos;get into it&apos; with these people. They are a fire looking for a reaction, and if we give it to them, their fire grows. When we cut off reaction, it sucks all the air from their fire and it is usually extinguished and they leave. 

In addition, we are not LIKE them. The community should see a difference. They will not see any difference if trucks full of hard men are giving us the finger and we&apos;re giving it back. For the innocent bystander looking at that exchange, they would have no idea who was right or wrong. We would both look the same. They go low, and we go high.

On 2/6 we had a mentally unwell man return who had been out to agitate us 2 weeks prior. This second time, he agitated to the point he was in people&apos;s personal space and was lunging at our protestors. He attacked one of the women in our group. Men in the group got him restrained until police arrived. Before the protest on 2/13, we will have a BRIEF meeting about the principles of nonviolence and we will assign jobs should we face another emergency. Preparedness is key. This will be a great opportunity to share skills you have learned demonstrating with other groups. Please come be part of the community as we learn from the wisdom in our group.</p>

<h3>Reimagine Resistance - The Work of Illumination</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Monday, February 23, 2026 at 12:00 AM UTC - 1:30 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Brix Cider<br>119 S 2nd St<br>Mount Horeb, WI 53572</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> WisDems</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Resistance is not a knee jerk response to alarm. Resistance does not mean hardening ourselves into a dark, protective shell. Resistance isn’t always about pushing back louder and harder.
Resistance can be about walking into dark places and finding a way to shine some light even where it seems impossible.
We will gather for an evening of shared reflection around the realities and human impact of ICE and immigration enforcement. The night will include music and poetry as well as some informative guest speakers.
We are grateful to welcome Dan Zimmerman, coordinator of the Dane Sanctuary Coalition, and David Couper, retired Madison Police Chief and pastor, among confirmed speakers.
There will also be an open mic for those who wish to share information, stories, questions, or creative expression.
This is not a rally.
It is not a debate.
It is not a performance of righteousness.
It is a space to illuminate what feels overwhelming, and to remember that even when the dark feels impenetrable, a small light still matters.
All are welcome.</p>

<h3>ICE OUT</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 21, 2026 at 6:00 PM UTC - 8:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Sidewalk in front of John Muir<br>Stewart Circle &amp; South 17th Avenue<br>Wausau, WI 54401</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Across the country, ICE and Border Patrol continue to escalate abusive and unaccountable enforcement—conducting raids without transparency, using excessive force against protesters, and undermining basic constitutional and human rights. Communities have witnessed federal agents targeting families, intimidating legal observers, and operating with near-total impunity, fueling fear rather than safety.

These actions are not isolated—they are part of a growing pattern that demands public resistance. Showing up matters. When we take to the streets, we send a clear message that our communities reject violence, secrecy, and the tearing apart of families. Join the ICE OUT protest and stand for dignity, accountability, and justice.
This action is a public call for humane policies that keep families together and respect the dignity of all people in our community.

We will also be collecting non-perishable food items to donate to Neighbor’s Place of Wausau, supporting local families in need.

All are welcome. Peaceful, lawful, and community-centered.

This a local Indivisible event!

*A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*</p>

<h3>Lake County Indivisibles - Youths - ICE Out</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Monday, February 16, 2026 at 5:00 PM UTC - 7:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Clermont City Hall<br>685 W Montrose Street, Clermont, FL 34711<br>Clermont, FL 34711</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>***Lake County Indivisibles - Youths - ICE Out***

***When and Where?***

Clermont City Hall - 685 W. Montrose St., Clermont, Florida
Monday - February 16, 2026 - 12:00 pm - 2:00 pm

***How?***

We will start with a short rally, which will include a few short speeches given by our new young Democracy Warriors. Then we will march slowly through Downtown Clermont, chanting and carrying our signs along the way. We will proceed to SR 50 to wave signs. 
***This protest is being organized by Lake County&apos;s youth who want to fight for their futures.***

***Why?***

We are tired and disgusted with what ICE is doing to the people in our country under the orders of a racist, cruel, and greedy administration. We, the People, are going to take our country back. 

***There is plenty of public parking in downtown Clermont.***

***What Not To Do?***

If approached by counter-protesters, do NOT engage. Just ignore them. They are sometimes very difficult to ignore, but their sole reason for being is to &quot;own us&quot;.

You may be tempted to talk with them if they put a microphone in your face, but resist that temptation! What to do? Ignore any that call you names, that give you the finger, that oppose you in any way. If we ignore them, they will get tired of doing it. They NEED your reaction. Don&apos;t give it to them!

*A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*</p>

<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>In the first week of 2026, the administration engaged in three flagrant abuses of power: (1) an unconstitutional military strike in Venezuela, (2) the extrajudicial murder of Renee Nicole Good by a member of the ICE paramilitary force for exercising her first amendment rights, and (3) the continued obstruction of justice for victims of Jeffrey Epstein’s child sex trafficking ring. A month into 2026, the administration has escalated their unchecked aggression against allies like Greenland and countries like Cuba, Columbia, and Mexico. ICE has kidnapped preschoolers and used them as bait for their parents, and the administration is considering deploying military police to back them up.

In short: It’s not getting better and Congress is not meeting the moment. 

Democracy does not defend itself; it requires the active participation of the people. While countless Americans have already called, emailed, written letters, signed petitions, and while activist organizations have brought groups to Capitol Hill calling for impeachment, this moment demands something more visible, more direct, and more powerful: constituents showing up at congressional district offices, where staff rarely, if ever, engage with constituents.

Impeachment is not optional. It is the remedy mandated by the Constitution. Likewise, Congress holds the power to de-fund and abolish ICE. They aren’t acting because they do not have the political will to do so. So we will lend them some of ours.

WHO/WHEN:

FLARE USA, Citizens&apos; Impeachment, and 50501 Movement are proud to announce the next National Day of Action: in-district lobbying on February 17, 2026 for the impeachment of President Trump and the complete abolishment of ICE. Representatives will be in their districts; it&apos;s time to catch them at home. It&apos;s time to Remove the Regime AND abolish ICE!

Grassroots pro-democracy organizations (e.g., local chapters of Indivisible, Hands Off, 50501), progressive primary candidates, and other concerned citizens will join together in leading constituents into the local/in-district offices of all 435 US House Representatives to demand impeachment and the abolishment of ICE. 

Please see our attendee guide for more information on why we&apos;re mobilizing, specific goals, current news on impeachment, and a full guide, including scripts, for visiting and following up with your Representative&apos;s office at tinyurl.com/lobby217guide.

<h3>ICE Out For Good zephyrhills</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Monday, February 16, 2026 at 3:00 PM UTC - 11:30 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Alice Hall Community Center<br>38116 5th Ave<br>Zephyrhills, FL 33542</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Wednesday, January 7th, an American citizen was killed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Minneapolis, Minnesota. This killing is part of a broader pattern of unchecked violence, impunity, and abuse carried out by federal immigration enforcement agencies against members of our communities. 

A broad coalition of groups across the country is calling for a coordinated Ice Out For Good Weekend of Action on Saturday, January 10th and Sunday, January 11th to demand accountability, honor the life lost, and make visible the human cost of ICE’s actions. 

A core principle behind all ICE Out For Good events is a commitment to nonviolent action and no civil disobedience. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values, and to act lawfully at these events. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events. All events should be held in public spaces or on public property.

<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Office of Rep Mark Alford<br>2401 Bernadette Dr<br>Columbia, MO 65203</p>

National Day of Action – February 17, 2026 -- 
Call, Email, or Make an Appointment. Register for the event to receive your email and/or call or visit script. 

They’ll be home in their districts. We’re meeting them there.
FLARE USA, Citizens’ Impeachment, and the 50501 Movement are organizing coordinated, in-district office visits across all 435 House districts to demand:

--Impeachment of President Trump
--Defunding and abolishing ICE
--Constituents will show up directly at district offices to insist Congress use its constitutional authority or flood their email and phone lines.

Why Now
In the first weeks of 2026, the administration has escalated what many see as unconstitutional military aggression abroad and deadly, abusive ICE enforcement at home. Congress has not acted with the urgency this moment demands.

Democracy requires pressure.
Calls and petitions matter — but in-person constituent presence is harder to ignore.
Impeachment is a constitutional remedy. Congress also controls federal funding, including for ICE. If they lack political will, we will provide it.

All participants are committed to lawful, non-violent engagement.</p>

<h3>Stop 287g, Abolish ICE! Lakeland, FL</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 28, 2026 at 9:30 PM UTC - 11:30 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Lakeside Village Mall<br>1479 Town Center Dr<br>Lakeland, FL 33803</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p># 🛑 Stop 287g ⛓️‍💥 Abolish ICE 🧊 Save the Everglades 🐊
*Hosted by DEFUND OLIGARCHY · BLESSED BY LIBERTY · INDIVISIBLE*
([en español](https://mobilize.us/s/skrhfa))

#### Non-Partisan Public Demonstration — Saturday, Jan 24, 2026
##### Lakeland, FL

For 01/24, we are meeting at 4:00 pm at the intersection, but we will be more on the side in front of Starbucks and Louis Papa&apos;s, but outside the mall, not inside the mall. Locally this is a small assembly, but we are in solidarity with many other groups throughout the nation demonstrating against Avelo, 287g agreements, and human rights abuses in small cities just like ours.

##### Read all instructions

We are taking a stand for ICE abolition and against the removal of individuals without due process — violating the core principles of our republic. 

This is a call to action. We’re joining forces to demand that Polk County end its involvement in unconstitutional detention policies.

# 🪧 Our Demands
✊ Polk County Government, it’s ICE or us.

You cannot serve both the people and an agency that tears families apart, starves humans, withholds water, denies medical care, kills people, forces humans into slavery, performs sterilizations without consent, and refuses to recognize U.S. birth certificates and REAL ID.

✊ Polk County residents: Boycott anyone profiting from ICE

✊ Polk County: End 287g agreement.

✊ DHS &amp; James Uthmeier: No Alligator Alley Concentration Camp. No cages on sacred ground. 🐊

✊ ICE: Stay out of Florida. Stop terrorizing schools, hospitals, courthouses, and workplaces. End detention. Process only violent offenders with criminal convictions.

✊ LPD &amp; PCSO: Do not cooperate with ICE. Arrest ICE agents operating without signed judicial warrants for violent criminal offenders.

✊ Sheriff Grady Judd: Stop collaborating with ICE until DHS reforms are complete. PSCO should not be helping send people to concentration camps.

✊Scott Franklin, Rick Scott, Ashley Moody: Defund &amp; abolish ICE. 

✊ Florida State Legislature: Ban the use of state taxpayer money for ICE operations. Pass legislation banning cooperation with ICE beyond what federal law requires.


# 🛑 WHY WE’RE PROTESTING

❌U.S. citizens and work permit holders — like Juan Carlos Lopez-Gomez and Heidy Sanchez Tejeda — have been detained without cause.

❌DHS &amp; ICE have unilaterally seized protected land in the Everglades to create a 5,000-person prison with no A/C and no access to lawyers by raiding FEMA and charging the state $450 million, despite the objections of county and tribal leadership. 

❌Children are being separated from parents, denied legal representation, and even deported during active custody disputes — like two-year-old citizen known as V.M.L.

❌Our Constitutional rights — due process, legal counsel, protection from executive overreach — are being ignored.

# ✨ WE STAND FOR:
- Families
- Immigration rights
- Due process
- Constitutional liberty for all
- Holding corporations accountable for profiting from human suffering

# 🗓️ EVENT DETAILS

📍 Lakeland, FL 

🕒 Saturday, Jan 24, 2025, 4 pm - 6 pm

🎨 Signs provided (but feel free to bring your own especially if it highlights the case of individuals who have been unlawfully detained or removed)

🌞 Dress for the weather &amp; wear sunscreen, sunglasses, and a mask for privacy

🚶‍♀️ Accessible sidewalks

📢 We will be singing and chanting

🚻 Nearby public restrooms available

# 💡 TIPS

👍We are committed to nonviolence and having a peaceful assembly. Stay respectful in all interactions.

👍Be alert: impersonators and fake news outlets posing as independent media may be present. Verify credentials before giving an interview.

👍Don’t engage with trolls or agitators. They may pretend to be a fellow protester. If they are really interested, you can point them towards the pamphlets and literature that we have. Remember we are fighting for everyone&apos;s rights, even the people that don&apos;t agree with us and the ones that are really annoying.

👍Focus your energy on building unity and protecting our democratic, constitutional republic.

# 🎶 SING FOR LIBERTY 
### We recommend brushing up on these songs if you like to sing along, but we alternate a lot with regular chanting and mini speeches, so no pressure to sing.

<h3>No Kings Vero Beach Protest</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, March 28, 2026 at 8:00 PM UTC - 9:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Target<br>5800 20th St<br>Vero Beach, FL 32966</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Democrats of Indian River</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>When: March 28th, 4:00PM-5:00PM
Where: Lining the sidewalks on both sides of 20th st going west, starting at target and CVS
Who: Protest Partners to be announced. If your group is interested in joining the coalition, please complete this form: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScLmz_UIbGv5WnKB7wvu5oU6bPNCsbd1magC5Ccts1-DCPTQw/viewform?usp=dialog

Across the U.S., the No Kings movement has drawn millions into the streets in peaceful, disciplined demonstrations demanding an end to cruelty, overreach, and the escalating abuses carried out under the Trump Administration; from mass immigration raids to threats of invoking the Insurrection Act. Organizers nationwide are doubling down on safety, de‑escalation, and community protection, building real infrastructure to keep people safe while we exercise our rights.

On March 28, Indian River County adds its voice.

Why We’re Showing Up:
-Because everyday people are appalled by the violence, the fear tactics, and the attacks on our neighbors by ICE
-Because attempts to suppress dissent have only generated more dissent.
-Because we refuse to accept a future shaped by white‑nationalist ambitions or unchecked executive power.
-Because we believe in defending our communities together.

This is a non violent action. As such, we urge everyone to be an active participant in ensuring it remains so. There will be counterprotestors and agitators, some who are there solely with the intention of getting people arrested. Please ignore them and encourage the people around you to do the same. 

If you witness any escalations whether it involves protestors, agitators, or law enforcement, please record from a safe distance if you are able. You can submit incident reports, including video/photos at: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeiygFLqhy1Zosf2toAB4RAFHct6O8CWbuY4mP9lmJA8j8dyw/viewform?usp=sharing&amp;ouid=100039941444542164704

There will be trained organizers on site identifiable by vests and nametags.  We encourage you to bring any developments to their attention while prioritizing recording.

Please stand 3 feet from the curb and encourage those around you to do so. This is for your own safety. Ron Desantis has declared that protestors can be hit for “self defense” if they are surrounding a car and the driver feels threatened.

<h3>March Monthly Meeting with Defend &amp; Recruit</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, March 3, 2026 at 11:00 PM UTC - 12:30 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>St Mark Lutheran Church<br>1120 Curlew Rd<br>Dunedin, FL 34698</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible North Pinellas</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Join us for our monthly meeting! Our mission is to model and promote grassroots engagement and participatory democracy and to ensure the values and interests of all are prioritized over corporate power and wealth. We are committed to social justice that honors and defends the rights of all.

**This month, we have a special presentation from Defend and Recruit. 

Trump&apos;s immigration crackdown is tearing communities apart.
He’s escalating raids, targeting immigrants, proudly separating families – even detaining U.S. citizens. His policies and ICE’s lawlessness has taken lives, devastated hundreds of thousands of people, and threaten millions more.

Learn about immigration defense campaigns and strategies to defend our people and build power in your community. This introduction training will cover the basics of immigration defense, including starting a neighborhood ICE watch,  building 4th Amendment Workplaces, winning municipal resolutions and legislation to support our communities and taking on corporations enabling ICE.

Join us for this informative introduction into building an ICE defense network. 

***REGISTRATION IS REQUIRED as seating is limited. There will be a Zoom option available. 

🚗Carpooling encouraged. Please park in the lot along the south side of the building adjacent to Curlew Road.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
<h3>National Day of Lobbying: Sen Rick Scott and Sen Ashley Moody at Tampa Office</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, February 17, 2026 at 3:00 PM UTC - 11:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Sam Gibbons Federal Building<br>801 N Florida Ave<br>Tampa, FL 33602</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> 50501Missouri</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>In the first week of 2026, the administration engaged in three flagrant abuses of power: (1) an unconstitutional military strike in Venezuela, (2) the extrajudicial murder of Renee Nicole Good by a member of the ICE paramilitary force for exercising her first amendment rights, and (3) the continued obstruction of justice for victims of Jeffrey Epstein’s child sex trafficking ring. A month into 2026, the administration has escalated their unchecked aggression against allies like Greenland and countries like Cuba, Columbia, and Mexico. ICE has kidnapped preschoolers and used them as bait for their parents, and the administration is considering deploying military police to back them up.

In short: It’s not getting better and Congress is not meeting the moment. 

Democracy does not defend itself; it requires the active participation of the people. While countless Americans have already called, emailed, written letters, signed petitions, and while activist organizations have brought groups to Capitol Hill calling for impeachment, this moment demands something more visible, more direct, and more powerful: constituents showing up at congressional district offices, where staff rarely, if ever, engage with constituents.

Impeachment is not optional. It is the remedy mandated by the Constitution. Likewise, Congress holds the power to de-fund and abolish ICE. They aren’t acting because they do not have the political will to do so. So we will lend them some of ours.

WHO/WHEN:

FLARE USA, Citizens&apos; Impeachment, and 50501 Movement are proud to announce the next National Day of Action: in-district lobbying on February 17, 2026 for the impeachment of President Trump and the complete abolishment of ICE. Representatives will be in their districts; it&apos;s time to catch them at home. It&apos;s time to Remove the Regime AND abolish ICE!

Grassroots pro-democracy organizations (e.g., local chapters of Indivisible, Hands Off, 50501), progressive primary candidates, and other concerned citizens will join together in leading constituents into the Tampa office of Sen. Scott and Sen. Moody to demand impeachment and the abolishment of ICE. 

We are also hosting a peaceful rally in front of their offices from 5 pm - 6 pm

Please see our attendee guide for more information on why we&apos;re mobilizing, specific goals, current news on impeachment, and a full guide, including scripts, for visiting and following up with your Representative&apos;s office at tinyurl.com/lobby217guide. 

By registering for the event, you are agreeing that event partners may receive your contact information and communicate with you about related activities. 

All participants are committed to lawful, non-violent action and no civil disobedience.</p>

<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>In cooperation with The Interfaith Alliance, we are hosting a weekly vigil/demonstration on 49th street by the Pinellas Courthouse Complex.

At least 30 people died in ICE “Detention” in 2025. Currently more than 59,000 immigrants are being held by ICE, separated from friends, family, and enduring inhumane conditions. Our government via ICE is perpetrating human right violations. We will not stand by while watching it happen. Please join us for this weekly action, in solidarity with the mothers, fathers, sons and daughters being held by ICE. We will not stop til the detention centers are closed and our immigrant friends are given due process and released.

*A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*</p>

Let’s take this boycott campaign right to them until Home Depot publicly denounces ICE on their properties.

You can bring a letter saying you do not support Home Depot allowing ICE to use their property as a hunting ground for non-violent, law-abiding immigrants; and they’ll be hand delivered to the store manager.

        <name>National Day of Lobbying: Impeach, Convict, Remove, and Defund ICE - Springfield, MO (MO-07)</name>
        <description><![CDATA[
<h3>National Day of Lobbying: Impeach, Convict, Remove, and Defund ICE - Springfield, MO (MO-07)</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, February 17, 2026 at 3:00 PM UTC - 11:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>MO District 7 Congressman Eric Burlison’s office<br>3232 E Ridgeview St<br>Springfield, MO 65804</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> 50501Missouri</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>In the first week of 2026, the administration engaged in three flagrant abuses of power: (1) an unconstitutional military strike in Venezuela, (2) the extrajudicial murder of Renee Nicole Good by a member of the ICE paramilitary force for exercising her first amendment rights, and (3) the continued obstruction of justice for victims of Jeffrey Epstein’s child sex trafficking ring. A month into 2026, the administration has escalated their unchecked aggression against allies like Greenland and countries like Cuba, Columbia, and Mexico. ICE has kidnapped preschoolers and used them as bait for their parents, and the administration is considering deploying military police to back them up.

In short: It’s not getting better and Congress is not meeting the moment. 

Democracy does not defend itself; it requires the active participation of the people. While countless Americans have already called, emailed, written letters, signed petitions, and while activist organizations have brought groups to Capitol Hill calling for impeachment, this moment demands something more visible, more direct, and more powerful: constituents showing up at congressional district offices, where staff rarely, if ever, engage with constituents.

Impeachment is not optional. It is the remedy mandated by the Constitution. Likewise, Congress holds the power to de-fund and abolish ICE. They aren’t acting because they do not have the political will to do so. So we will lend them some of ours.

WHO/WHEN:

FLARE USA, Citizens&apos; Impeachment, and 50501 Movement are proud to announce the next National Day of Action: in-district lobbying on February 17, 2026 for the impeachment of President Trump and the complete abolishment of ICE. Representatives will be in their districts; it&apos;s time to catch them at home. It&apos;s time to Remove the Regime AND abolish ICE!

Grassroots pro-democracy organizations (e.g., local chapters of Indivisible, Hands Off, 50501), progressive primary candidates, and other concerned citizens will join together in leading constituents into the local/in-district offices of all 435 US House Representatives to demand impeachment and the abolishment of ICE. 

Please see our attendee guide for more information on why we&apos;re mobilizing, specific goals, current news on impeachment, and a full guide, including scripts, for visiting and following up with your Representative&apos;s office at tinyurl.com/lobby217guide. 

By registering for the event, you are agreeing that event partners may receive your contact information and communicate with you about related activities. 

All participants are committed to lawful, non-violent action and no civil disobedience.</p>

<h3>The 46th Weekly Sarasota Rally Against Fascism</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, February 17, 2026 at 2:00 PM UTC - 4:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>2001 Siesta Dr<br>Sarasota, FL 34239</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Join us for our 46th weekly rally in Sarasota to resist fascism, get ICE off our streets, and support Social Security. Meet like-minded people who are standing up for our rights. Help save the Social Security we paid for and our families are paying for.
------------------------------------------------
* No Trump “ICE GOONS” in SARASOTA Schools!
* No concentration camps!
* No kidnapping of innocent people!
------------------------------------------------
This is a local, Sarasota-based, grassroots rally by Indivisible Sarasota.
WE ARE SEEN BY 2,500-3,000 VEHICLES EACH WEEK!

We meet outside the Social Security office, at the intersection of Siesta Drive and South Tamiami Trail. (see map) The big sign there is for the restaurant, Flemings.

The rally is in the shade and during morning rush hour, so it will be relatively cool but with a lot of visibility.

Parking is right across Siesta Drive in the empty shopping mall parking lot.
By persisting week after week, we are showing the people of Sarasota that we are in this for the long term and will persevere as long as necessary.
Expect lots of supportive honking of horns.
Bring your own sign about Social Security or any other topic related to the resistance against the MAGA attack on our democracy.
See you there!</p>

<h3>PALM BEACH INDIVISIBLES (PBC): &quot;NO KINGS&quot;</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, March 28, 2026 at 3:00 PM UTC - 5:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Target - Palm Beach Lakes, Blvd. WPB<br>1760 Palm Beach Lakes Blvd<br>West Palm Beach, FL 33401</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Palm Beach Indivisibles</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>NO KINGS - NO THRONES - NO CROWNS


Palm Beach Indivisibles is organizing another powerful Palm Beach County “NO KINGS” protest on Saturday, March 28, 2026, from 11:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. The moment is now, and the stakes could not be higher.

Our last NO KINGS action brought nearly 4,000 people to the front lines of one of the most heavily traveled corridors in the county, commanding the attention of thousands of residents and U.S. and international visitors alike. This time, we’re going even bigger.

Crowds of 6,000 or more are expected to flood the streets in a united stand to Fight Fascism, Defend Democracy, and demand a country that works for all of us—not just the billionaire class. We will raise our voices against ICE abuses, the crushing cost of living, and the rise of millionaire and billionaire oligarchs who believe power belongs to them alone.

This is not a spectator moment. History is written by those who show up. Bring your signs. Bring your neighbors. Bring your outrage and your hope. If you’ve ever said, “enough is enough,” this is where you turn words into action.

No kings. No oligarchs. No silence.
March with us. Show up. Be counted.</p>

Please park along the frontage road - do not park in the hotel parking lot as you may be towed.

A core principle behind all ICE Out For Good events is a commitment to nonviolent action and no civil disobedience. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values, and to act lawfully at these events. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events. All events should be held in public spaces or on public property.

<h3>ICE OUT for GOOD - Bridge Brigade Visibility Action</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 14, 2026 at 5:00 PM UTC - 6:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Overpass adjacent to Lucy Winton Bell Fields<br>15601 Hudson Rd N<br>Lake Saint Croix Beach, MN 55043</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Afton Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>About this event:

Wednesday, January 7th, a fellow Minnesotan was killed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Minneapolis, Minnesota. This killing is part of a broader pattern of unchecked violence, impunity, and abuse carried out by federal immigration enforcement agencies against members of our communities.

A broad coalition of groups across the country is calling for a coordinated Ice Out For Good Weekend of Action on Saturday, January 10th and Sunday, January 11th to demand accountability, honor the life lost, and make visible the human cost of ICE’s actions.

We are all Renee.

A core principle behind all ICE Out For Good events is a commitment to nonviolent action and no civil disobedience. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values, and to act lawfully at these events. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events. All events should be held in public spaces or on public property.

<h3>Joyful Resistance Coral Springs #NoICENoWar</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Friday, May 1, 2026 at 8:30 PM UTC - 10:30 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>University Drive in front of the Northwest Regional Library<br>3151 N University Dr<br>Coral Springs, FL 33065</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> May Day Strong</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Trump is waging war and committing murder to enrich his billionaire backers. We are fighting to stop him. **Stand with us and take action this weekend to demand an end to the occupation of Venezuela and our cities.** 

We’re focusing on corporate targets - companies set to benefit most from the occupation of ICE or Venezuela. 

This week, our target is **Hilton Hotels**, housing this administration&apos;s ICE goons.

**We stand united demanding an end to the Venezuelan occupation and the removal of reckless untrained ICE agents from our communities.** And we&apos;re taking our fight to the companies that are backing this administration and benefiting most.

**Together we will hit these companies in their pocketbooks, force the administration to end the occupation of Venezuela and our cities and spread the word to our neighbors that we deserve better.**

Every dollar spent in wars overseas or at home is a dollar we paid for with our taxes - a dollar that could and should go to helping our communities thrive. We can have good jobs, better schools, access to healthcare and get our basic needs met. But not while our government works for billionaires and not for us.

Join us, stand strong and speak up.

<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 21, 2026 at 5:00 PM UTC - 8:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Corner of US1 &amp; E<br>5000 N Federal Hwy<br>Fort Lauderdale, FL 33308</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>This is a local Indivisible Wilton Manors event.

The F.A.F.O March, Forever Against Fascist Oppression March.

Join us as we march from Fort Lauderdale, over the bridge, in to Lauderdale By The Sea (LBTS), to protest there against this administration and their current actions in our country against it&apos;s own people.
We the people RESIST &amp; REJECT all forms of authoritarian and fascist regimes!
Stand with us, march with us, walk with us. EVERYONE is needed! Join us wherever you can join us from, if the walk is too long meet us enroute.

Why Lauderdale By The Sea?
Because they have sided with the corrupt, wannabe dictator, and are renaming a street after him! They do not care about anyone in our community and have demonstrated this by allowing their elected officials to dictate that the street will be renamed after the convicted Felon. Even after We The People stood up, spoke out and voted in majority against the renaming of one of OUR STREETS after a sexual abuser and friend of abusers.
We do NOT support nor enable this administration nor their violent terroristic government funded ICE agents nor their delusional, weak, cowardly leader. We do not support business&apos; that support them either!
While not all of LBTS stands by this attack on our community, our families, our friends, our loved ones, MANY DO!!!!
WE RESIST! WE SAY NO TO ALL FORMS OF OPPRESSION!
We are WE THE PEOPLE and WE SAY FUCK ALL FASCISTS!
F.A.F.O FOREVER AGAINST FASCIST OPPRESSION!

*A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
<h3>National Day of Lobbying: Impeach, Convict, and Remove HOT SPRINGS, AR (AR-04)</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, February 17, 2026 at 6:30 PM UTC - 7:30 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>101 Reserve St<br>Hot Springs, AR 71901</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> 50501Missouri</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>In the first week of 2026, the administration engaged in three flagrant abuses of power: (1) an unconstitutional military strike in Venezuela, (2) the extrajudicial murder of Renee Nicole Good by a member of the ICE paramilitary force for exercising her first amendment rights, and (3) the continued obstruction of justice for victims of Jeffrey Epstein’s child sex trafficking ring. A month into 2026, the administration has escalated their unchecked aggression against allies like Greenland and countries like Cuba, Columbia, and Mexico. ICE has kidnapped preschoolers and used them as bait for their parents, and the administration is considering deploying military police to back them up.

In short: It’s not getting better and Congress is not meeting the moment. 

Democracy does not defend itself; it requires the active participation of the people. While countless Americans have already called, emailed, written letters, signed petitions, and while activist organizations have brought groups to Capitol Hill calling for impeachment, this moment demands something more visible, more direct, and more powerful: constituents showing up at congressional district offices, where staff rarely, if ever, engage with constituents.

Impeachment is not optional. It is the remedy mandated by the Constitution.

WHO/WHEN:

FLARE USA, Citizens&apos; Impeachment, and 50501 Movement are proud to announce the next National Day of Action: in-district lobbying on February 17, 2026 for the impeachment, conviction, and removal of President Trump. Representatives will be in their districts; catch them at home and demand they use their power to remove this unconstitutional regime!

Grassroots pro-democracy organizations (e.g., local chapters of Indivisible, Hands Off, 50501), progressive primary candidates, and other concerned citizens will join together in leading constituents into the local/in-district offices of all 435 US House Representatives to demand impeachment. 

Please see our attendee guide for more information on why we&apos;re mobilizing, specific goals, current news on impeachment, and a full guide, including scripts, for visiting and following up with your Representative&apos;s office at tinyurl.com/lobby217guide. 

By registering for the event, you are agreeing that event partners may receive your contact information and communicate with you about related activities. 

All participants are committed to lawful, non-violent action and no civil disobedience.</p>

We have an ongoing food drive to support Poverello our local food pantry and a diaper drive to support Preggo organization for women. Bring your heart and your signs as we sing, dance, shout and let it all out! No one likes this authoritarian regime and we certainly do not agree to anyone&apos;s rights being taken away from them. Join us in the heart of our beautiful LGBTQIA+ city as we stand up for the constitution, due process &amp; justice for all, protecting our immigrant community from this administrations attempt to terrorize them, protecting women&apos;s rights and our families friends and neighbors. Be PROUD, show your COURAGE and stand OUT against this administration and all its hatred of those that may be different from them. Our rights are being eroded away in the LGBTQIA+ community. Our Trans sisters and brothers are being attacked. Our freedom to marry the person we love is being attacked. This ends with us all standing up and saying NO!!! We had a AMAZING turnout to our No Kings Oct 18th at Coral Ridge Mall &amp; the beach but that is just the beginning! You have seen us out on the streets now it&apos;s time for you to join us! Driving by? Honk your horn in support and make a plan to attend another music festival soon. Bring a sign, hat, sunscreen, water and some friends and family. It&apos;s time. Join us.

A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.</p>

<h3>Collier Know Your Rights &amp; Neighborhood Safety</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 21, 2026 at 5:00 PM UTC - 7:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Cornerstone United Methodist<br>8200 Immokalee Rd<br>Naples, FL 34119</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>This is a **Indivisible Gambit SWFL** event!
Indivisible Gambit SWFL, in collaboration with the **ACLU of Florida, Florida Immigration Coalition, Unidos Immokalee, and Voices of Bonita**, is taking action — and we invite you to join us.

Across our communities, many people are *feeling anxious, uncertain, and afraid.* That reaction **is normal.** Fear is often the goal of authoritarian systems: to isolate us, silence us, and make us feel powerless. But **courage is a choice** and choosing courage together is how we protect one another and how we win.

We invite you to join us

 **Saturday, February 21, 2026, 12:00–2:00 PM** for a Community Education and Organizing event at:

**Cornerstone United Methodist Church**
8200 Immokalee Road
Naples, FL 34119-9718

This gathering is designed to expand our outreach and strengthen local support networks by sharing practical, life-saving information and building community capacity.

At this event, participants will:

* Learn practical ways to stay safe and understand their rights
* Recognize and respond to concerning ICE activity
* Learn how volunteer legal observers educate community members and document encounters
* Get involved in rapid response, neighborhood watch efforts, and mutual aid
* Discover ways to support at-risk migrant families with basic needs

We are also actively recruiting and training:

* Volunteer legal observers
* Rapid responders
* Neighborhood watch volunteers
* Community members willing to assist with mutual aid

No one should face these moments alone. When we show up for each other informed, organized, and courageous we build real safety and real power.

We hope you’ll join us, bring a friend, and be part of this growing network of care, courage, and community defense.

*A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*</p>

<h3>#IceOUT Campaign National Organizing Call</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Thursday, February 12, 2026 at 5:00 PM UTC - 6:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> ResistTrump Campaign</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has become a pillar of fear, surveillance, and authoritarian control. Communities across the U.S. are pushing back through lawful, nonviolent protest to expose ICE’s abuses and resist its presence in our neighborhoods.

Every week, the ResistTrump Campaign (www.resisttrump.us) will convene organizers and activists on this national call to plan actions, share resources, and strengthen the movement to drive ICE out of our cities.

On this call, you’ll be able to connect with others who are:

- Leading or joining local ICE protest campaigns

- Learning effective, nonviolent tactics for resisting ICE facilities and operations

- Building solidarity with immigrant communities

- Coordinating creative actions that highlight ICE as a pillar of the Trump regime

This is your place to learn, collaborate, and take bold, lawful action. Together, we can resist ICE and weaken the authoritarian system it supports.</p>

<h3>Day Out for Democracy</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Monday, February 16, 2026 at 7:30 PM UTC - 9:30 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Stewart Park<br>2700 12th Ave S<br>Minneapolis, MN 55404</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Minnesota AFL-CIO</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Join us as we honor the dead and fight like hell for the living!

Minnesota remains under occupation. Armed and masked federal agents continue tearing through our communities - both in the Twin Cities and Greater Minnesota. They continue to detain immigrants and peaceful observers regardless of citizenship or immigration status.

Despite these long weeks and the federal government violating our constitutional rights and even shooting and killing two of our own – Minnesotans remain resilient and will continue to do so for as long as it takes.

Join fellow Minnesotans from all walks of life for a march through Minneapolis as we call for an end to ICE’s occupation, support the small businesses that have had our backs through this crisis, and demand accountability.

Program beginning at 1:30PM
March begins at 2PM
 
Our Demands:

•	ICE Out of Minnesota immediately.

•	Justice and accountability for Renee Good, our Union Brother Alex Pretti, and all victims of ICE&apos;s cruelty and violence.

•	Rescind ICE Funding and REAL immigration reform.

•	Invest in recovering and rebuilding our communities.

•	Restore sensitive locations (like schools) protections that were unlawfully repealed by Executive Order in January of 2025

NOTE: Any Union that is sponsoring this event and is subject to PELRA or a no-strike clause is not asking their members to participate in any form of work stoppage.

<h3>Minnesota families: caucus to get ICE out of schools!</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Wednesday, March 4, 2026 at 12:30 AM UTC - 2:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> TakeAction Minnesota</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Elections f**king matter, and everyday people like us have a powerful role to play in determining which candidates get a huge leg up in their race. From school board members to elected prosecutors to the governor, we deserve politicians who actually act to get ICE out of our schools, and who deliver the housing for all, food support, universal pre-K, and universal health care -- and more! -- that our families and communities deserve. 

We&apos;re getting trained in how to get politicians to deliver.

At this training you&apos;ll learn and practice how to show up where your voice has outsize power: precinct caucuses. (&quot;Precinct caucus&quot; is a gatekeeping phrase that means &quot;neighborhood meeting.&quot; These meetings happen all over Minnesota the evening of Feb 3, 2026.) 

The decisions everyday people make at this meeting determine which candidates get &quot;endorsed&quot; by a political party -- and get all all the votes, resources, and support that come with an endorsement. 

We&apos;ll learn what precinct caucus is, why it matters, and how we can show up to make sure that only #FamiliesOverBillionaires and #ICEout candidates get what they need to run competitive races.</p>

<p><strong>When:</strong> Sunday, February 15, 2026 at 6:00 PM UTC - 8:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Hwy 100 Pedestrian Bridge<br>2450 Lilac Dr N<br>Golden Valley, MN 55422</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>On Wednesday, January 7th, an American citizen, Renee Nicole Good, was killed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Minneapolis, Minnesota. On Saturday, January 24th, another American citizen, Alex Pretti was tackled and killed by multiple ICE agents in Minneapolis. This killing is part of a broader pattern of unchecked violence and abuse carried out by federal immigration enforcement agencies against members of our communities.

Since then, ICE has only escalated in abducting, harassing, and terrorizing our immigrant friends, family, and neighbors throughout MN. They break laws without abandon. They violate our constitutional rights. And we need to continue to speak out and raise awareness of their atrocities.

This event is to continue to build solidarity in resistance to ICE&apos;s actions, and connect community members with resources to help us through this invasion. Join us in telling ICE to leave MN for Good!

We will gather at the pedestrian bridge over Highway 100 in Golden Valley with our protest signs in a show of solidarity and resistance against the current ICE occupation of our state. This is to increase visibility and awareness that we want ICE OUT of MN.

A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.</p>

<h3>NO ICE NO FEAR</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 21, 2026 at 3:00 PM UTC - 5:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Collier County Courthouse<br>3315 Tamiami Trl E<br>Naples, FL 34112</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>NO ICE NO FEAR is rally that refuses silence, submission and intimidation. We gather to confront a system that terrorizes families, shatters communities and rules through FEAR - to say, loudly and together, that we will not accept it.

A government that KIDNAPS, CAGES and KILLS peaceful people is not a democracy - it is a dictatorship. This rally is a call to abolish cruelty masquerading as law enforcement, to end raids &amp; deportations, and to defend the dignity &amp; humanity of immigrants without compromise.

We stand visible, unafraid and unapologetic:  Our communities will not be policed by fear and justice will not wait

*A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*</p>

<h3>NO KINGS</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, March 28, 2026 at 2:00 PM UTC - 4:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Collier County Courthouse<br>3315 Tamiami Trl E<br>Naples, FL 34112</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>American Patriots in Minneapolis showed the nation what dedicated peaceful protesters can do. Despite the very present danger of ICE violence &amp; killings these American Heroes forced Trump to Back Down on the ICE Occupation of their city and got ICE Gruppenfuhrer Bovino removed from his command.  This is only a pause as the Trump Regime will come up with more Extremist Authoritarian actions to weaken our Democracy.  A coalition of pro-Democracy groups is stepping up together to carry out another far larger NO KINGS Day of rallies &amp; resistance to Dictatorship.  We need all those who care about the future of our nation &amp; its Democracy to join the millions of others that will be participating in this impactful event nationwide event.

        <name>National Day of Lobbying: Impeach, Convict, Remove, &amp; Defund ICE - JOPLIN, MO (MO-07)</name>
        <description><![CDATA[
<h3>National Day of Lobbying: Impeach, Convict, Remove, &amp; Defund ICE - JOPLIN, MO (MO-07)</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, February 17, 2026 at 7:00 PM UTC - 8:30 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Eric Burlison&apos;s Joplin Office<br>2727 E 32nd St<br>Joplin, MO 64804</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> 50501Missouri</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p># In the first week of 2026, the regime engaged in three flagrant abuses of power: 
## (1) an unconstitutional military strike in Venezuela, 
## (2) the extrajudicial murder of Renee Nicole Good by a member of the IÇE paramilitary force for exercising her first amendment rights, and 
## (3) the continued obstruction of justice for victims of Jeffrey Epstęin’s child sex trafficking ring. 
A month into 2026, the t®*mp regime has escalated their unchecked aggression against allies like Greenland and countries like Cuba, Columbia, and Mexico. IÇE has kidnapped preschoolers and used them as bait for their parents, and the regime is considering deploying military police to back them up.

### In short: It’s not getting better and Congress is not meeting the moment. 

**Democracy does not defend itself; it requires the active participation of the people.** While countless Americans have already called, emailed, written letters, signed petitions, and while activist organizations have brought groups to Capitol Hill calling for impeachment, this moment demands something more visible, more direct, and more powerful: **constituents showing up at congressional district offices, where staff rarely, if ever, engage with constituents.**

### Impeachment is not optional. It is the remedy mandated by the Constitution. Likewise, Congress holds the power to de-fund and abolish IÇE. They aren’t acting because they do not have the political will to do so. So we will lend them some of ours.

**WHO/WHEN:**

FLARE USA, Citizens&apos; Impeachment, and 50501 Movement are proud to announce the next National Day of Action: in-district lobbying on February 17, 2026 for the impeachment of &apos;president&apos; t®*mp and the complete abolishment of IÇE. Representatives will be in their districts; it&apos;s time to catch them at home. It&apos;s time to Remove the Regime AND abolish IÇE!

Grassroots pro-democracy organizations (e.g., local chapters of Indivisible, Hands Off, 50501), progressive primary candidates, and other concerned citizens will join together in leading constituents into the local/in-district offices of all 435 US House Representatives to demand impeachment and the abolishment of IÇE.

*Please note: A core principle behind all our events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events.*

<h3>Plymouth Weekly Saturday Protest</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 14, 2026 at 6:00 PM UTC - 7:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>2700 Annapolis Cir N<br>Plymouth, MN 55441</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>This a local Indivisible event!

We are gathering every week on Saturday to protest the ICE occupation in this country. 

Meet at highway 55 and Northwest Blvd at noon. Organizers will be at the northwest corner, but feel free to use crosswalks to safely stand on the other corners. Do not park in the lot of the SW corner of the intersection as the business owners have requested protesters not use their lot. Please don’t park in areas of the streets with no parking signs. Per Plymouth PD we are allowed to park on Annapolis Circle N parallel to 55 in front of McD’s from the end of the road up to the No Parking sign but not past it.

At our 01/31/26 protest, it was reported that someone came by toward the end who was repeatedly asking for information from a protester. This location is very near a hotel known to be housing federal agents. For the safety of our community, please do not give anyone identifying information. Peacefully disengage anyone behaving like this and alert the organizers.

Water will be provided as well as extra signs for those who want them.

*A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*</p>

-Justice and accountability for Renee Good, our Union Brother Alex Pretti, and all victims of ICE&apos;s cruelty and violence.

-Invest in recovering and rebuilding our communities.

-Restore sensitive locations (like schools) protections that were unlawfully repealed by Executive Order in January of 2025</p>

<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Americans for Democracy</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>After four powerful weeks of protests pushing back against ICE’s presence in Minnesota, we are coming together again this weekend. These actions have been about more than protest — they’ve been about building community, standing in solidarity, and refusing to stay silent.
Join us as we continue to push back, support one another, and show that Minnesota will not tolerate fear or violence in our communities.
Stand with us. Bring a friend. This week we&apos;re encouraging signs love and solidarity for one another while showing ICE we are a strong community and they&apos;re not welcome here! Let’s keep showing up. This Saturday 11- 1:00 p.m.

Alongside the ICE Out of Minnesota protest, we will be collecting food for immigrant families who are afraid to leave their homes due to ICE activity and the risk of arrest or deportation. Your donations help keep our neighbors safe and fed.

Some of the items needed-
Baby items- diapers of all sizes, baby food and wipes
Flour, sugar, baking soda, cooking oil, spices 
Peanut butter, canned meats 
Fresh fruits and vegetables
Coffee and tea 
Rice and canned goods

The donations will be collected at the welcome table.
You may park in the library parking lot.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
<h3>National Day of Lobbying: Impeach, Convict, Remove, and Defund ICE Oklahoma City (OK-05)</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, February 17, 2026 at 3:00 PM UTC - 11:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Oklahoma State Capitol<br>2300 N Lincoln Blvd<br>Oklahoma City, OK 73105</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> 50501Missouri</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>In the first week of 2026, the administration engaged in three flagrant abuses of power: (1) an unconstitutional military strike in Venezuela, (2) the extrajudicial murder of Renee Nicole Good by a member of the ICE paramilitary force for exercising her first amendment rights, and (3) the continued obstruction of justice for victims of Jeffrey Epstein’s child sex trafficking ring. A month into 2026, the administration has escalated their unchecked aggression against allies like Greenland and countries like Cuba, Columbia, and Mexico. ICE has kidnapped preschoolers and used them as bait for their parents, and the administration is considering deploying military police to back them up.

In short: It’s not getting better and Congress is not meeting the moment. 

Democracy does not defend itself; it requires the active participation of the people. While countless Americans have already called, emailed, written letters, signed petitions, and while activist organizations have brought groups to Capitol Hill calling for impeachment, this moment demands something more visible, more direct, and more powerful: constituents showing up at congressional district offices, where staff rarely, if ever, engage with constituents.

Impeachment is not optional. It is the remedy mandated by the Constitution. Likewise, Congress holds the power to de-fund and abolish ICE. They aren’t acting because they do not have the political will to do so. So we will lend them some of ours.

WHO/WHEN:

FLARE USA, Citizens&apos; Impeachment, and 50501 Movement are proud to announce the next National Day of Action: in-district lobbying on February 17, 2026 for the impeachment of President Trump and the complete abolishment of ICE. Representatives will be in their districts; it&apos;s time to catch them at home. It&apos;s time to Remove the Regime AND abolish ICE!

Grassroots pro-democracy organizations (e.g., local chapters of Indivisible, Hands Off, 50501), progressive primary candidates, and other concerned citizens will join together in leading constituents into the local/in-district offices of all 435 US House Representatives to demand impeachment and the abolishment of ICE. 

Please see our attendee guide for more information on why we&apos;re mobilizing, specific goals, current news on impeachment, and a full guide, including scripts, for visiting and following up with your Representative&apos;s office at tinyurl.com/lobby217guide. 

By registering for the event, you are agreeing that event partners may receive your contact information and communicate with you about related activities. 

All participants are committed to lawful, non-violent action and no civil disobedience.</p>

​Join us on Saturday, Febuary, 14th, from 11:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m.

​This current administration has become increasingly violent and lawless. They are harrassing, arresting, and detaining people who are just trying to work and raise their families. They have murdered citizens in cold blood. We are taking to the streets to demand immediate accountability and an end to the systemic violence that threatens our neighborhoods.

​We will no longer tolerate federal agencies operating with total impunity. Stand with us. Let&apos;s show Wylie how LOVE ❤️ can overcome HATE.

A core principle behind these protests is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values and to act lawfully at these events.

<h3>ICE OUT / STAND UPFOR DEMOCRACY &amp; THE RULE OF LAW</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 14, 2026 at 5:00 PM UTC - 6:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>SOCIAL SECURITY OFFICE<br>2201 Colorado Blvd<br>Denton, TX 76205</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Wednesday, January 7th, an American citizen was killed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Minneapolis, Minnesota. This killing is part of a broader pattern of unchecked violence, impunity, and abuse carried out by federal immigration enforcement agencies against members of our communities. 

A broad coalition of groups across the country is calling for a coordinated Ice Out For Good Weekend of Action on Saturday, January 10th and Sunday, January 11th to demand accountability, honor the life lost, and make visible the human cost of ICE’s actions. 

A core principle behind all ICE Out For Good events is a commitment to nonviolent action and no civil disobedience. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values, and to act lawfully at these events. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events. All events should be held in public spaces or on public property.

Indivisible is managing data and communications with participants. By registering, you agree to receive info from Indivisible about the event, receive communications via e-mail or SMS message from Indivisible, and receive any other updates and opportunities to take action or support ICE OUT FOR GOOD partner organizations. You also agree to have any data entered in this registration collected by Indivisible. Indivisible will treat your data according to our organization’s applicable privacy policy: https://indivisible.org/privacy-policy</p>

<h3>Stop I.C.E. For GOOD! Feb. 14 TX-24 Solidarity Event</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 14, 2026 at 5:00 PM UTC - 6:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Apple Southlake Town Square<br>260 Grand Ave<br>Southlake, TX 76092</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible TX-24</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Show Up Time!  

Take a stand for democracy! Take a stand for Silverio Gonzalez. For Renee Good. For Carlos Jimenez, Marimar Martinez, and Alex Pretti. Just some of the names of people shot by Trump&apos;s DHS during immigration enforcement operations. 

The most recent shooting victim, that resulted in a death, was VA nurse, Alex Pretti of Minneapolis. Mr Pretti&apos;s final words were, “Are you OK?” 

America is not OK. ICE is out-of-control, terrorizing, injuring, and killing innocent people. This Saturday we will stand in solidarity with Minneapolis as we read the names of the innocent people who have been harmed by ICE. We will also protest to demand that Apple return the ICEBlock app to the Apple Store so communities can be safe from warrantless, violent ICE raids. 

Saturday is election day for voters in special election SD9. The Pretti Good protest is conveniently located just steps away from a polling place in Southlake Town Hall, Room 3A-3D, 1400 Main Street.

Showing up to vote and to protest are more important now than ever. Use your power and take a stand for democracy! 

Indivisible events are peaceful and practice de-escalation! Do not engage! Do not take the bait!</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
<h3>National Day of Lobbying: Impeach, Convict, Remove, and Defund ICE - WACO, TX (TX-17)</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, February 17, 2026 at 8:00 PM UTC - 9:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>400 Austin Ave<br>Waco, TX 76701</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> 50501Missouri</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>In the first week of 2026, the administration engaged in three flagrant abuses of power: (1) an unconstitutional military strike in Venezuela, (2) the extrajudicial murder of Renee Nicole Good by a member of the ICE paramilitary force for exercising her first amendment rights, and (3) the continued obstruction of justice for victims of Jeffrey Epstein’s child sex trafficking ring. A month into 2026, the administration has escalated their unchecked aggression against allies like Greenland and countries like Cuba, Columbia, and Mexico. ICE has kidnapped preschoolers and used them as bait for their parents, and the administration is considering deploying military police to back them up.

In short: It’s not getting better and Congress is not meeting the moment. 

Democracy does not defend itself; it requires the active participation of the people. While countless Americans have already called, emailed, written letters, signed petitions, and while activist organizations have brought groups to Capitol Hill calling for impeachment, this moment demands something more visible, more direct, and more powerful: constituents showing up at congressional district offices, where staff rarely, if ever, engage with constituents.

Impeachment is not optional. It is the remedy mandated by the Constitution. Likewise, Congress holds the power to de-fund and abolish ICE. They aren’t acting because they do not have the political will to do so. So we will lend them some of ours.

WHO/WHEN:

FLARE USA, Citizens&apos; Impeachment, and 50501 Movement are proud to announce the next National Day of Action: in-district lobbying on February 17, 2026 for the impeachment of President Trump and the complete abolishment of ICE. Representatives will be in their districts; it&apos;s time to catch them at home. It&apos;s time to Remove the Regime AND abolish ICE!

Grassroots pro-democracy organizations (e.g., local chapters of Indivisible, Hands Off, 50501), progressive primary candidates, and other concerned citizens will join together in leading constituents into the local/in-district offices of all 435 US House Representatives to demand impeachment and the abolishment of ICE. 

Please see our attendee guide for more information on why we&apos;re mobilizing, specific goals, current news on impeachment, and a full guide, including scripts, for visiting and following up with your Representative&apos;s office at tinyurl.com/lobby217guide. 

By registering for the event, you are agreeing that event partners may receive your contact information and communicate with you about related activities. 

All participants are committed to lawful, non-violent action and no civil disobedience.</p>

Help show Cedar Park how many of us work to end GOP fascism and corruption -- ICE OUT! No War! No Kings &amp; No Dictators, End GOP Corruption, Fund the ACA, and more.

Bring handheld signs for the bridge traffic. Our collection of banners overlooking the highway is growing fast!

Join us 3-5 pm for our peaceful banner and popup event, each January Monday afternoon.

While the large banners overlook the 183A tollway, several of us will proudly display signs facing traffic on E Park. 

Parking is easy, the bridge is &quot;protestor friendly.&quot; Only drawback is that no public rest room is available, so be prepared for that!

Hope to see you Monday!</p>

<h3>Dems and Friends Thursday Ice House Crawl</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Friday, February 27, 2026 at 12:00 AM UTC - 2:30 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Breakaway Brewing<br>1518 E Grayson St<br>San Antonio, TX 78208</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Bexar County Democrats</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Every Thursday, 6-8 PM, we go to a different place with a laid back vibe just to schmooze and find out who&apos;s who. We also discover ice houses and other neighborhood watering holes that tell us a story about San Antonio history and culture.

Our motto, like the American Revolutionaries is &quot;Join or Die!&quot; because together we can do anything and separately, we can do nothing. And we think the best way to join is by having fun. A laid back vibe and good beer, interesting casual conversation, some good food, and VOILA! Fun and friends! 

The Crawls and the Dems are going to be bigger, better and bolder right here, right now. So we&apos;re looking for new friends to join the old. Bring someone with you, meet someone new as well as getting together with old friends for a good mix and mingle. If you&apos;re curious about what Democrats are about, this is a good way to learn about them in a natural habitat.

This is a low expectation event--no hard start or stop time--come and go when you feel like it--no sitting in one spot, no listening to speakers, no pressure to volunteer, not even talking about politics unless you want to.  All you have to do is say hi to someone you don&apos;t know and be nice.</p>

<h3>Dems and Friends Thursday Ice House Crawl</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Friday, February 13, 2026 at 12:00 AM UTC - 2:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Bombay Bicycle Club<br>3506 N St Mary&apos;s St<br>San Antonio, TX 78212</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Bexar County Democrats</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Every Thursday, 6-8 PM, we go to a different place with a laid back vibe just to schmooze and find out who&apos;s who. We also discover ice houses and other neighborhood watering holes that tell us a story about San Antonio history and culture.

Now more than ever we need to get together and visualize how we are going to build a rock solid team to Get Out the Vote in 2026. We think the best way to start is by having fun. A laid back vibe and good beer, interesting casual conversation, some good food, and VOILA! Fun and friends! 

The Crawls and the Dems are going to be bigger, better and bolder right here, right now. So we&apos;re looking for new friends to join the old. Bring someone with you, meet someone new as well as getting together with old friends for a good mix and mingle. If you&apos;re curious about what Democrats are about, this is a good way to learn about them in a natural habitat.

<h3>Signs of Solidarity - Business KYR Training and Canvass Peoria St - Montbello</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, March 7, 2026 at 4:00 PM UTC - 5:30 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Fire House #3<br>3172 Peoria St<br>Aurora, CO 80010</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Denver Action</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Our hearts are broken by the events in Minneapolis.  We are upset with the unlawful actions of federal agents there.  We will not sit idly by and wait for that chaos to be visited on the Denver area.

Join us to be trained to canvass local businesses and to share with them Know Your Rights information to help them protect themselves and their employees in case of a raid by ICE. We share with them the importance of making a plan, training employees and creating safe spaces, and we suggest what employees should or should not do. We tell them how to report wrong doing by ICE and CBP.  At the end attendees will have the opportunity to canvass local businesses.

Canvassing is a demonstration of our solidarity with all of our Denver community and has been received warmly by the businesses visited.  Since our founding in 2016, Indivisible has been rooted in the belief that organized people can beat organized hate—and that our power comes not just from our numbers, but from how we show up. We reject all forms of political violence and intimidation, no matter the source or the target.</p>

<h3>Love Not Fear: Stop Palantir - Valentine’s Day Sidewalk Action</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 14, 2026 at 7:00 PM UTC - 9:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Cherry Creek North<br>2nd and Detroit<br>Denver, CO 80206</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Denver Action</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>This Valentine’s Day, we’re choosing love over fear.

Palantir’s multi-million-dollar contracts with ICE power surveillance and data platforms that drive detention, deportation, workplace raids, and family separation. These technologies spread fear through our neighborhoods and harm immigrant communities.

In 1942 the US Government changed the rules and used Census Data to find and put people of Asian descent in detention camps.

Today, Palantir provides data mining and analytics software to identify immigrants for detention and deportation.

OUR ASK: PALANTIR STOP WORKING WITH ICE. 

Join us for a peaceful sidewalk action outside Palantir headquarters to say clearly: Do not work with ICE – Cancel all contracts.

Bring your heart, your voice, and your commitment to justice. Signs and chants welcome. 

A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.</p>

        <name>National Day of Lobbying: Impeach, Convict, Remove, and Defund ICE - Colorado Springs, CO (CO-05)</name>
        <description><![CDATA[
<h3>National Day of Lobbying: Impeach, Convict, Remove, and Defund ICE - Colorado Springs, CO (CO-05)</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, February 17, 2026 at 10:30 PM UTC - 12:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Office of US Congressman Jeff Crank<br>455 E Pikes Peak Ave 103<br>Colorado Springs, CO 80903</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> 50501Missouri</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>In the first week of 2026, the administration engaged in three flagrant abuses of power: (1) an unconstitutional military strike in Venezuela, (2) the extrajudicial murder of Renee Nicole Good by a member of the ICE paramilitary force for exercising her first amendment rights, and (3) the continued obstruction of justice for victims of Jeffrey Epstein’s child sex trafficking ring. A month into 2026, the administration has escalated their unchecked aggression against allies like Greenland and countries like Cuba, Columbia, and Mexico. ICE has kidnapped preschoolers and used them as bait for their parents, and the administration is considering deploying military police to back them up.

In short: It’s not getting better and Congress is not meeting the moment. 

Democracy does not defend itself; it requires the active participation of the people. While countless Americans have already called, emailed, written letters, signed petitions, and while activist organizations have brought groups to Capitol Hill calling for impeachment, this moment demands something more visible, more direct, and more powerful: constituents showing up at congressional district offices, where staff rarely, if ever, engage with constituents.

Impeachment is not optional. It is the remedy mandated by the Constitution. Likewise, Congress holds the power to de-fund and abolish ICE. They aren’t acting because they do not have the political will to do so. So we will lend them some of ours.

WHO/WHEN:

FLARE USA, Citizens&apos; Impeachment, and 50501 Movement are proud to announce the next National Day of Action: in-district lobbying on February 17, 2026 for the impeachment of President Trump and the complete abolishment of ICE. Representatives will be in their districts; it&apos;s time to catch them at home. It&apos;s time to Remove the Regime AND abolish ICE!

Grassroots pro-democracy organizations (e.g., local chapters of Indivisible, Hands Off, 50501), progressive primary candidates, and other concerned citizens will join together in leading constituents into the local/in-district offices of all 435 US House Representatives to demand impeachment and the abolishment of ICE. 

Please see our attendee guide for more information on why we&apos;re mobilizing, specific goals, current news on impeachment, and a full guide, including scripts, for visiting and following up with your Representative&apos;s office at tinyurl.com/lobby217guide. 

By registering for the event, you are agreeing that event partners may receive your contact information and communicate with you about related activities. 

All participants are committed to lawful, non-violent action and no civil disobedience.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
<h3>National Day of Lobbying: Impeach, Convict, Remove, and Defund ICE - Fort Collins, CO(CO-02)</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, February 17, 2026 at 6:00 PM UTC - 8:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>1220 S College Ave Room 100A<br>Fort Collins, CO 80524</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> 50501Missouri</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>In the first week of 2026, the administration engaged in three flagrant abuses of power: (1) an unconstitutional military strike in Venezuela, (2) the extrajudicial murder of Renee Nicole Good by a member of the ICE paramilitary force for exercising her first amendment rights, and (3) the continued obstruction of justice for victims of Jeffrey Epstein’s child sex trafficking ring. A month into 2026, the administration has escalated their unchecked aggression against allies like Greenland and countries like Cuba, Columbia, and Mexico. ICE has kidnapped preschoolers and used them as bait for their parents, and the administration is considering deploying military police to back them up.

In short: It’s not getting better and Congress is not meeting the moment. 

Democracy does not defend itself; it requires the active participation of the people. While countless Americans have already called, emailed, written letters, signed petitions, and while activist organizations have brought groups to Capitol Hill calling for impeachment, this moment demands something more visible, more direct, and more powerful: constituents showing up at congressional district offices, where staff rarely, if ever, engage with constituents.

Impeachment is not optional. It is the remedy mandated by the Constitution. Likewise, Congress holds the power to de-fund and abolish ICE. They aren’t acting because they do not have the political will to do so. So we will lend them some of ours.

WHO/WHEN:

FLARE USA, Citizens&apos; Impeachment, and 50501 Movement are proud to announce the next National Day of Action: in-district lobbying on February 17, 2026 for the impeachment of President Trump and the complete abolishment of ICE. Representatives will be in their districts; it&apos;s time to catch them at home. It&apos;s time to Remove the Regime AND abolish ICE!

Grassroots pro-democracy organizations (e.g., local chapters of Indivisible, Hands Off, 50501), progressive primary candidates, and other concerned citizens will join together in leading constituents into the local/in-district offices of all 435 US House Representatives to demand impeachment and the abolishment of ICE. 

Please see our attendee guide for more information on why we&apos;re mobilizing, specific goals, current news on impeachment, and a full guide, including scripts, for visiting and following up with your Representative&apos;s office at tinyurl.com/lobby217guide. 

By registering for the event, you are agreeing that event partners may receive your contact information and communicate with you about related activities. 

All participants are committed to lawful, non-violent action and no civil disobedience.</p>

<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>5505 W 20th Ave<br>Edgewater, CO 80214</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Denver Action</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>NW Denver has amazing people going out to talk with local businesses to let them know that we care about our immigrant neighbors. We share information with business owners, managers &amp; employees about constitutional rights and self-protection should they face ICE raids. 

This event is oriented towards trained canvassers.  Please bring your own flyers and let us know if you need laminated signs or Red Cards.  

This work is best done in pairs or small groups where we know each other. We invite you to meet with us to start the day with coffee and then go canvassing nearby businesses.

We will meet near W 20th Ave. and Depew St. at a local business at 9:30 AM where we will purchase our own coffee and snacks and spend about 30 minutes getting to know each other. You&apos;ll receive suggestions for a couple of nearby commercial areas to canvass.

After canvassing we will meet at 12:00 noon at the Edge Art Gallery 6501 W. Colfax Ave., Lakewood, CO.  for a debrief and to view an art installation on immigration by one of our members.

If you have questions, email Joel at gtgdgov@gmail.com

Since our founding in 2016, Indivisible has been rooted in the belief that organized people can beat organized hate—and that our power comes not just from our numbers, but from how we show up. We reject all forms of political violence and intimidation, no matter the source or the target.</p>

<h3>BI - Drop Your ICE Contracts</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 28, 2026 at 9:00 PM UTC - 10:30 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>BI Corporate Headquarters<br>6265 Gunbarrel Ave Suite B<br>Boulder, CO 80301</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> SoBoCo Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>In 2025, ICE paid BI Incorporated over $171.5 million for their electronic monitoring or “e-carceration” tools. That includes a secretive $1.6 million
contract for a bounty hunter-like service called “skip tracing”, where BI Incorporated tracks the locations of immigrants in their communities for ICE ERO. They are currently owned by GEO which is a private prison company that runs the Aurora Concentration Camp for detainees.

Join us outside BI&apos;s Boulder County offices to let them know we do not want businesses here that support ICE! We demand BI drop those contracts!!!</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
<h3>National Day of Lobbying: Impeach, Convict, Remove, and Defund ICE | Billings (MT-02)</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, February 17, 2026 at 5:00 PM UTC - 7:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Rep. Troy Downing&apos;s office (building exterior)<br>401 N 31st St<br>Billings, MT 59101</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> 50501Missouri</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>In the first week of 2026, the administration engaged in three flagrant abuses of power: (1) an unconstitutional military strike in Venezuela, (2) the extrajudicial murders of Renee Nicole Good and Alex Pretti by members of ICE&apos;s paramilitary force for exercising their First Amendment rights, and (3) the continued obstruction of justice for victims of Jeffrey Epstein’s child sex trafficking ring. A month into 2026, the administration has escalated their unchecked aggression against allies like Greenland and countries like Cuba, Columbia, and Mexico. ICE has kidnapped preschoolers and used them as bait for their parents, and the administration is considering deploying military police to back them up.

In short: It’s not getting better and Congress is not meeting the moment. 

Democracy does not defend itself; it requires the active participation of the people. While countless Americans have already called, emailed, written letters, signed petitions, and while activist organizations have brought groups to Capitol Hill calling for impeachment, this moment demands something more visible, more direct, and more powerful: constituents showing up at congressional district offices, where staff rarely, if ever, engage with constituents.

Impeachment is not optional. It is the remedy mandated by the Constitution. Likewise, Congress holds the power to de-fund and abolish ICE. They aren’t acting because they do not have the political will to do so. So we will lend them some of ours.

WHO/WHEN:

The Billings MT action is hosted by Resistance Montana, a group of grassroots organizers promoting cooperation and solidarity in Montana&apos;s protest movement.

FLARE USA, Citizens&apos; Impeachment, and 50501 Movement are proud to announce the next National Day of Action: in-district lobbying on February 17, 2026 for the impeachment of President Trump and the complete abolishment of ICE. Representatives will be in their districts; it&apos;s time to catch them at home. It&apos;s time to Remove the Regime AND abolish ICE!

Grassroots pro-democracy organizations (e.g., local chapters of Indivisible, Hands Off, 50501), progressive primary candidates, and other concerned citizens will join together in leading constituents into the local/in-district offices of all 435 US House Representatives to demand impeachment and the abolishment of ICE. 

Please see our attendee guide for more information on why we&apos;re mobilizing, specific goals, current news on impeachment, and a full guide, including scripts, for visiting and following up with your Representative&apos;s office at tinyurl.com/lobby217guide. 

By registering for the event, you are agreeing that event partners may receive your contact information and communicate with you about related activities. 

All participants are committed to lawful, non-violent action and no civil disobedience.</p>

<h3>Solidarity in Community Aid</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Thursday, February 19, 2026 at 1:30 AM UTC - 3:30 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Salt Lake City Public Library<br>210 E 400 S<br>Salt Lake City, UT 84111</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>As ICE tears up our communities, and anti- diversity, equity and inclusion laws harm our marginalized communities, we must stand in solidarity in many ways. We protest, we rally, we write and call our elected officials. These actions are powerful, but the harm done to our neighbors is not relieved.

Solidarity in Community Aid is our community coming together to support students in crisis. Join us Wednesday, February 18th at 6:30 p.m. at the Salt Lake City Library to learn how community aid can help affected students.

Without recourse to institutional support as once provided by dedicated diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, our community stands ready to lend support wherever needed. Join us to be a part of the solution rather than an onlooker to the crisis unfolding before us.

Speakers will be Dr. Ana Antunes, Juliet Reyonalds, State Senator Nate Blouin, and student Bhavika Malik. This will be in-person only, so please sign up here.

<h3>STOP ICE KIDNAPPINGS &amp; MURDERS</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Thursday, February 12, 2026 at 11:00 PM UTC - 1:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Corner of La Cholla and Ina<br>North La Cholla Boulevard &amp; West Ina Road<br>Casas Adobes, AZ 85704</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Stop the Coup, AZ</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Join us Thursday, Feb 12 from 4-6pm at this protest being held on a busy corner in northern Tucson - La Cholla Blvd and Ina Rd. The organizer will be at the NE corner but protesters are welcome to protest at every corner. Parking information below &amp; under &quot;accessibility.&quot;

Costumes Welcome!  Signs will be available.

(For the best sign visibility, consider bold, think letters at least 4&quot; tall to make your sign readable to drivers.) Also: Signs will be available for a small donation.
                                                                                                  
This is a peaceful protest and will follow all safety protocols. Media will be notified - we had 600 people on Jan 29th.

Protesting is one of the pillars of resistance of an Authoritarian takeover. We the People can help give others the courage to resist.
Congress is negotiating a deal to fund Trump’s Department of Homeland Security (DHS) that is killing people in the streets, taking our children, and trampling our constitutional rights. A temporary stopgap measure will likely fund DHS through February 13th while negotiations continue. We must keep up the pressure on Congress to protect our communities.

Ample parking on 3 of the 4 corners. Specifically: You can park on the NE corner in the large parking lot where the Albertson&apos;s and other stores are located OR you can park on the NW corner in the big parking lot where the Barnes and Noble &amp; other businesses are located and there is parking on the SW corner around the Dollar Tree Store area.</p>

        <name>Pinal County Board of Supervisors&apos; Meeting</name>
        <description><![CDATA[
<h3>Pinal County Board of Supervisors&apos; Meeting</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Wednesday, February 18, 2026 at 4:30 PM UTC - 7:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Board of Supervisors Hearing Room<br>135 N Pinal St<br>Florence, AZ 85132</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Queen Creek San Tan Valley Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Pinal County has referred County Attorney Brad Miller to AZ AG Kris Mayes for investigation regarding his contract with ICE signed in August and tearing through the peace on our streets until January 7th.  Today (February 9), ICE has been active on the streets of Pinal County again.  PCSO has been out in force, and ICE has been reported.  It is unclear if PCSO is directly working with ICE, which is a problem given the report from the BOS meeting in January.  We will update this invitation as we learn more.  

We sent a thank-you note to the BOS for their referral of Brad Miller to the AG&apos;s office.  They have also taken time to speak with us and hear our concerns and we appreciate that.  We have signs saying &quot;Thank you&quot; and others that can be held up by those attending the meeting.  

We want to support the BOS when they are making choices to protect taxpayer monies, our neighbors, and our families.  Please come to the BOS meeting to help us show solidarity for our neighbors who are vulnerable when ICE comes into our communities.  Brad Miller expressed that he disagrees with the BOS, and we need to step up and be as proactive as we can!

[Click here to find the agenda when it becomes available](https://www.pinal.gov/Calendar.aspx?EID=3224)

Observations between September and January 7th:

The Task Force Model is the one we began seeing on our streets beginning in August. This model seemed to use PCSO to pull over people of color, take their time to give a ticket while they waited for ICE, then monitor the situation, assist, and protect ICE during the abduction. We have not seen this type of law enforcement stop since the county began consulting attorneys on the matter. With ICE descending upon our state as I type, we do not want Brad Miller to unleash the Task Force Model on our neighborhoods again. During the time he was illegally cooperating with ICE from August through January, I personally saw 3 stops in and near my neighborhood. They were agressive and one of the people detained was an American.</p>

There were approx. 135 287(g) agreements when Biden left office. There are now 1000+ active agreements in the US and growing under the Trump administration. 

- Mesa PD and ICE have had a 287(g) agreement since 2009

- Reports prove that these agreements lead to racial profiling and civil rights abuses

<h3>Join Mesa Valley Indivisible to Protest ICE Deportations &amp; the AROCC Detention Center</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 21, 2026 at 4:00 PM UTC - 7:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>South Gilbert Road &amp; East Broadway Road<br>Mesa, AZ 85204</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Mesa Valley Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>## 🛫 ICE &amp; AROCC: Stop ICE operations at Mesa Gateway Airport!

For the past eight months, [Mesa Valley Indivisible](https://www.mesavalleyindivisible.org/) members and a coalition of groups around the country have been working relentlessly to end Avelo Airlines’ involvement in the unlawful and inhumane deportation of primarily non‑violent immigrants via Mesa Gateway Airport. 

Americans dedicated to ending Avelo&apos;s contract with ICE boycotted, protested, emailed and called our representatives/senators, held weekly meetings, etc. and on January 7, 2026, news broke that Avelo Airlines announced they were ending their ICE deportation flights!!

As we all celebrate this **HUGE WIN**, we also know ICE deportation flights are still occurring at the Mesa Gateway Airport &amp; the AROCC detention center remains active on the grounds. We can happily check off Avelo Airlines now, but it is time to move on to the next challenge which is ending ICE deportation flights &amp; closing the AROCC at our Mesa Gateway Airport! 

## 📢Join us on Saturday, February 21st, to challenge the use of the local airport for what are illegal, inhumane, and unconstitutional removal operations.

### 🆘Key Concerns Driving the Protest:

- **Corporate Complicity in Inhumane Practices**: These deportations are driven by profit and political patronage. Private contractors run detention and flight operations through non‑commercial hubs, creating durable infrastructure that outlasts elections. The incentive loop is clear: **more arrests → more funding → more capacity → more bodies.**


- **Conditions on the Ground**: Individuals slated for deportation or transfer are held in a secluded facility at the Mesa airport—near where commercial travelers dine—where they are reportedly kept without access to basic amenities like beds or showers until their flight.


- **Inhumane Treatment on Flights**: Documentation over years has shown that passengers on these flights are typically shackled for the entire duration, denied bathroom access, and subjected to severe abuse, including beatings, restrictive restraints, and reports of deaths and miscarriages.


- **Secrecy and Lack of Transparency**: Aircraft are often disguised through subcontractors and subleases, and the flights themselves are secretive and unmarked, shielding the carriers and the airport from public scrutiny.


### 🪧Signs &amp; Graphics

Please create signs and graphics that are relevant to ICE deportations &amp; the AROCC! Some ideas include:

* Abolish ICE
* ICE separates families
*42 days does not = temporary
* Illegal deportations without due process is human trafficking


###  ⚠️Protest Information

🚗 Parking is available around the intersection 

⭐ Please share with friends, family, neighbors, EVERYONE!

📸 When posting photos/videos online, please make sure to tag the Mesa Valley Indivisible social media page and clearly state Mesa Valley Indivisible as the protest organizer. The goal is to raise our group&apos;s profile which will make it easier for new people to find &amp; join our community while also increasing our influence with government officials and the media! In order to have a greater impact on our city, people have to know we exist first!!

This is NOT the Tempe Town Lake bridge; this bridge is between Price and McClintock, hence why we are meeting at Cole Park. Cole Park has an entrance to the bridge. The bridge goes over the 60 highway. Parking is in the neighborhood. Please abide by all parking laws. For example, do not block a neighbor&apos;s driveway, park 20 feet from an intersection or 15 feet from a fire hydrant, etc Parking is also first-come, first-served; get there early for a good spot.

How to prepare:
By focusing on large, bold, high-contrast lettering and concise messages, you&apos;ll maximize the impact and readability of your bridge protest signs.</p>

<h3>ICE OUT FOR GOOD: We Stand with Our Neighbors- Anthem Indivisible</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 28, 2026 at 6:00 PM UTC - 8:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Carefree Highway Overpass<br>I-17 and Carefree Highway Phoenix, AZ 85086<br>Phoenix, AZ 85086</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Anthem Indivisible Arizona</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>### We Stand with Our Neighbors. 

We refuse to look away. Join **Anthem Indivisible on Saturday, February 28, 2026, from 11:00 AM to 1:00 PM** as we gather on the **Carefree Highway overpass** to stand in solidarity with our immigrant neighbors and raise our collective voice against the abuses carried out by ICE.

This action is part of our ongoing ICE OUT FOR GOOD series — peaceful, visible, people‑powered demonstrations that affirm our shared values of dignity, safety, and human rights. When we show up together, we send a clear message: our neighbors deserve protection, not persecution.

We’ll hold signs, wave to passing cars, and stand shoulder‑to‑shoulder in nonviolent community action. Whether you’ve been with us since the first rally or this is your first time, your presence strengthens our collective voice.

#### Arrival &amp; Rally Details

Please plan to arrive by **10:45 AM at the Chili’s parking lot at 34710 N North Valley Parkway, Phoenix, AZ 85086.** We&apos;ll head up together to the overpass for a prompt **11:00 AM start**. There will be cars to bring you to and from the overpass if you don&apos;t want to make the walk. The rally wraps up at **1:00 PM**.

#### Pro Tips for a Comfortable Rally:

 -  Bring a hat, wear sunscreen, and consider an umbrella for shade

 -  A portable stool can be helpful if you prefer to sit while holding your sign

 -  Hydrate! Bring water and whatever fuel you need to stay energized

 -  Creative signs and expressive sunglasses strongly encouraged

*A core principle behind all ICE Out For Good events is a commitment to nonviolent action and no civil disobedience. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values, and to act lawfully at these events. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events. All events should be held in public spaces or on public property.*</p>

<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Fate Brewing Company - Phoenix<br>4445 N 7th St<br>Phoenix, AZ 85014</p>

We have good work to do together between now and the midterms.
This simple, tangible act can change an election. Plus, we have a great time together. 

Everyone should come, even if your budget doesn’t have room for stamps. If you can afford postcard stamps, please bring them. If you can bring some extra stamps, we’d sure appreciate it! If you don’t have time to go to the post office, but can afford them, just donate the money for the stamps and we’ll get them for you.

Good food and drink available for purchase.

        <name>Rush-hour Resistance Rally @ ICE Field Office in Phoenix</name>
        <description><![CDATA[
<h3>Rush-hour Resistance Rally @ ICE Field Office in Phoenix</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Thursday, February 12, 2026 at 2:30 PM UTC - 3:30 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>2035 N Central Ave<br>Phoenix, AZ 85004</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Desert Democracy</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p># Welcome to the Rush-hour Resistance!


📣 [Rush Hour Resistance Rally](https://rhrr.us) began with a clear idea: **neighbors, gathering peacefully and regularly on busy nearby streets, could remind our communities that democracy is essential and that silence is unacceptable.** Over the last year, RhRR expanded from a handful of participants to multiple locations across the Valley, reaching thousands of pedestrians and motorists each week. This momentum is significant, as is the duty it brings.


🗳️ As we approach the midterm elections, our united mission is to safeguard free and fair elections and promote civic participation, particularly in local and primary races where every vote carries weight. **Our weekly rallies are more than outlets for frustration; they are consistent, visible commitments that normalize voting and democratic engagement as neighborly expectations.**


🕊️ RhRR is a peaceful, nonconfrontational movement. **Our goal is to reach the broader community, not to confront those seeking conflict.** When tensions surface, we withdraw, stay composed, and look out for one another. This discipline keeps our rallies inviting and helps newcomers feel secure joining us.


🫂 Most of all, RhRR is about people caring for one another while standing up for the future of our democracy. **Every person who shows up, every sign held, and every conversation sparked on a street corner is part of something larger and deeply hopeful.**


## Here’s what’s in store for our Thursday morning event in the Museum District, right in front of the ICE Field Office:


🕥 The event starts at 7:30 am. You are free to show up anytime, but we recommend arriving a few minutes early to introduce yourself. We end promptly at 8:30 am.

⚠️ There are many other groups protesting at that location all day, every Thursday. Some aren&apos;t quite as committed to being peaceful and nonconfrontational. RhRR only takes the first shift. What happens after is beyond our purview. 


🅿️ Parking is a bit of a challenge. Some of us park on Holly St, directly across from the ICE Field Office. We haven’t had issues before, but parking enforcement is unpredictable. If concerned, take the light rail. 


🖌️ One of RhRR’s strengths is that people feel free to express themselves. For this ICE-specific event, your signs will be focused on protecting neighbors and communities. Strong anti-ICE signs are always welcome. You may bring other signs that help articulate any of our three pillars:


- **Defending democracy and the rule of law**
- **Encouraging voting**
- **Protecting neighbors and communities** (e.g., immigrants, LGBTQIA+ people, workers, and veterans)


This approach keeps signs aligned with RhRR’s purpose, while preserving personal expression and emotional authenticity.  


🇺🇳 Flags, banners, and even inflatable costumes are welcome. Some blow lots of bubbles. While our mission is serious, humor and camaraderie matter.


😷 RhRRs are peaceful, public events. Most attendees don’t hide their faces, though some do; participate at your comfort level. Photos and videos are common on social media, but you can ask posters to remove accidental appearances.


Thanks in advance for joining us. See you on the streets! ✊Votin</p>

<h3>❌🧊 ICE OUT for Good - No ICE Detention in Surprise AZ</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 14, 2026 at 4:00 PM UTC - 5:30 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Bell Road &amp; North Civic Center Drive<br>Surprise, AZ 85374</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Northwest Valley Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>### **Weekly Protest: NO ICE DETENTION IN SURPRISE!**

📍 **Bell Rd &amp; Civic Center Dr, Surprise, AZ**  
🕘 **Every Saturday | 9:00–10:30 AM**

We are protesting weekly in Surprise, AZ in response to the ongoing overreach of ICE across the country, and the massive ICE detention facility coming to Surprise.

*A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values and to act lawfully at these events. Weapons of any kind should not be brought to events.*

As residents of **Arizona’s 8th &amp; 9th Congressional Districts**, we are calling on our representatives, **Abe Hamadeh and Paul Gosar**, and the **Surprise City Council** to publicly address and oppose this facility and any federal enforcement actions that endanger civil rights and community safety. Protecting constituents from government overreach is a core responsibility of elected office.

**Our demands:**

- No ICE detention in Surprise
- No new funding for ICE without real reform  
- Investigate the killings of Renee Good &amp; Alex Pretti
- End aggressive dragnet operations and mass surveillance  
- Restore transparency, accountability, and due process  

**Suggested messages for signs:**

- NO ICE FACILITY IN SURPRISE  
- CITY HALL, SAY NO TO ICE
- PROTECT OUR PEACE, NO ICE IN SURPRISE
- NO ICE NEAR SCHOOLS  
- JUSTICE FOR RENEE GOOD AND ALEX PRETTI  
- END ICE NOW  
- BELIEVE YOUR EYES NOT TRUMP’S LIES  
- NO ICE IN AZ  
- DUE PROCESS FOR ALL  

This protest is rooted in **nonviolence, clarity, and solidarity**. We welcome community members who believe no agency should operate above the law and that state power must be constrained by constitutional rights and public oversight.

**Bring signs, bring water, and bring your voice.**

**Parking:** Plenty of parking is available on the south side of Bell Rd. Please stay out of the urgent care parking lot at the corner and avoid parking near business entrances.

**Peaceful protest. No violence. No harassment. No escalation.**

Together, We Rise This is not just a call to action; it is a call to the heart. By standing together, we send a powerful message that we will not remain silent in the face of injustice. Let us continue to stand until justice prevails, and every individual is treated with the respect they deserve.

Join us, bring your compassion, and be a part of a movement that believes in the power of unity and love. Together, we can create a brighter, more just future for all.

<h3>FEB 20th! - Handmaids of LV - ICE OUT NOW! Downtown Las Vegas 3pm</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Friday, February 20, 2026 at 11:00 PM UTC - 12:30 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>ICE OFFICE - Downtown Las Vegas<br>501 Las Vegas Blvd S<br>Las Vegas, NV 89101</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Handmaids Las Vegas</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Join the Handmaids of Las Vegas: ICE Out for GOOD - We Stand With Minnesota!

Dear compassionate souls of Las Vegas,

Wednesday, January 7, 2026 an American citizen was killed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement )ICE) in Minneapolis, Minnesota and now another life, Alex Pretti, has been taken by ICE. These killings are part of a broader pattern of unchecked violence, impunity and abuse carried out by federal immigration enforcement agencies against members of our communities.

A broad coalition of groups across the country is calling for a coordinated solidarity actions to stand and say ICE OUT FOR GOOD! with Minnesota, and to demand accountability, honor the lives lost, and make visible the human cost of ICE&apos;s actions.

A core principle behind all ICE Out events is a commitment to nonviolent action and no civil disobedience. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values, and to act lawfully at these events. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events. All events should be held in public spaces or on public property. Handmaids of Las Vegas are managing data and communications with participants. By registering for this event, you agree to receive info from the Handmaids of Las Vegas about the event, receive communications via email and/or SMS messages, and receive any other updates and opportunities to take action or support ICE OUT STANDS AND PARCHES. You also agree to have any data entered in this registration collected by Handmaids of Las Vegas. We will treat your data according to our organizations privacy policy.

We invite you to join the Handmaids of Las Vegas as we unite in a powerful demonstration of solidarity for immigrant rights. On February 20, 2026, we will gather every other Friday at the ICE Offices in Downtown Las Vegas. Our stands will take place from 3pm PM to 4:30 PM, where we will stand together, clad in the iconic red uniforms of the handmaids, to echo the call for justice and equality.

A Stand for Dignity and Humanity Under the current Trump regime, immigrants and people of color have faced cruel and inhumane treatment. Families have been torn apart, and countless individuals have been subjected to unjust policies that strip away their dignity and rights. We believe that every person deserves to be treated with respect and compassion, regardless of their background or origin.

How You Can Show Support Join Us: Wear red and stand with us in solidarity. Your presence will amplify our message and show that our community stands united.

Together, We Rise This is not just a call to action; it is a call to the heart. By standing together, we send a powerful message that we will not remain silent in the face of injustice. Let us continue to stand until justice prevails, and every individual is treated with the respect they deserve.

Join us, bring your compassion, and be a part of a movement that believes in the power of unity and love. Together, we can create a brighter, more just future for all.

With hope and determination,

The Handmaids of Las Vegas</p>

        <name>National Day of Lobbying: Impeach, Convict, and Remove Spokane, WA (WA-05) - Letter writing/calls</name>
        <description><![CDATA[
<h3>National Day of Lobbying: Impeach, Convict, and Remove Spokane, WA (WA-05) - Letter writing/calls</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, February 17, 2026 at 3:00 PM UTC - 11:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>St Ann Catholic Church Hall on February 17th from 4 to 6 p.m.<br>2120 E 1st Ave<br>Spokane, WA 99202</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> 50501Missouri</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>In the first week of 2026, the administration engaged in three flagrant abuses of power: (1) an unconstitutional military strike in Venezuela, (2) the extrajudicial murder of Renee Nicole Good by a member of the ICE paramilitary force for exercising her first amendment rights, and (3) the continued obstruction of justice for victims of Jeffrey Epstein’s child sex trafficking ring. A month into 2026, the administration has escalated their unchecked aggression against allies like Greenland and countries like Cuba, Columbia, and Mexico. ICE has kidnapped preschoolers and used them as bait for their parents, and the administration is considering deploying military police to back them up.

In short: It’s not getting better and Congress is not meeting the moment. 

Democracy does not defend itself; it requires the active participation of the people. While countless Americans have already called, emailed, written letters, signed petitions, and while activist organizations have brought groups to Capitol Hill calling for impeachment, this moment demands something more visible, more direct, and more powerful: constituents showing up at congressional district offices, where staff rarely, if ever, engage with constituents.

Impeachment is not optional. It is the remedy mandated by the Constitution.

WHO/WHEN: 
The Saturday (February 14th ) before we will rally at B.A. Clark Park from 2 to 4:30 p.m.

FLARE USA, Citizens&apos; Impeachment, and 50501 Movement are proud to announce the next National Day of Action: in-district lobbying on February 17, 2026 for the impeachment, conviction, and removal of President Trump. Representatives will be in their districts; catch them at home and demand they use their power to remove this unconstitutional regime!

Grassroots pro-democracy organizations (e.g., local chapters of Indivisible, Hands Off, 50501 and SURJ), progressive primary candidates, and other concerned citizens will join together in leading constituents into the local/in-district offices of all 435 US House Representatives to demand impeachment. 

Please see our attendee guide for more information on why we&apos;re mobilizing, specific goals, current news on impeachment, and a full guide, including scripts, for visiting and following up with your Representative&apos;s office at tinyurl.com/lobby217guide. 

By registering for the event, you are agreeing that event partners may receive your contact information and communicate with you about related activities. 

All participants are committed to lawful, non-violent action and no civil disobedience.</p>

<h3>National Day of Lobbying: Impeach, Convict, Remove, and Defund ICE - Baker City, OR (Protest)</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, February 17, 2026 at 11:00 PM UTC - 12:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Auburn Avenue &amp; Main Street<br>Baker City, OR 97814</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> 50501Missouri</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>In the first week of 2026, the administration engaged in three flagrant abuses of power: (1) an unconstitutional military strike in Venezuela, (2) the extrajudicial murder of Renee Nicole Good by a member of the ICE paramilitary force for exercising her first amendment rights, and (3) the continued obstruction of justice for victims of Jeffrey Epstein’s child sex trafficking ring.

Impeachment is not optional. It is the remedy mandated by the Constitution. Likewise, Congress holds the power to de-fund and abolish ICE. They aren’t acting because they do not have the political will to do so. So we will lend them some of ours.

WHO/WHEN:

FLARE USA, Citizens&apos; Impeachment, and 50501 Movement are proud to announce the next National Day of Action: in-district lobbying on February 17, 2026 for the impeachment of President Trump and the complete abolishment of ICE. Representatives will be in their districts; it&apos;s time to catch them at home. It&apos;s time to Remove the Regime AND abolish ICE!

<h3>Canvass with Abel (Homeland)</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Sunday, February 15, 2026 at 7:00 PM UTC - 10:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Marion V. Ashley Community Center, Valley-Wide Recreation and Park District<br>25625 Briggs Rd Suite 2<br>Menifee, CA 92585</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Abel Chavez for Congress</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>We&apos;re talking to voters at their door to let them know about the importance of CA-48 to changing Congress and we&apos;re letting them know about Abel&apos;s bold economic agenda to bring immediate change to every American.  All you need is a pair of shoes, we&apos;ll provide water, snacks, and training.

Abel will fight for:

Medicare for All, because healthcare is a human right - not a profit center; not “more affordable healthcare,” not “more accessible healthcare,” not “eventually,” not “common sense reform.” Universal healthcare for every person in America, unapologetically.

Ending corporate &amp; foreign lobbying influence, so billionaires and special interests can’t purchase policy or politician’s votes

Banning Wall Street landlords in housing, because homes are for families - not hedge funds

Strengthening public education, so every child has the opportunity for a quality education that will land them a career with zero debt.

Defund ICE.</p>

<h3>ICE Out of Escondido Rally</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 28, 2026 at 6:00 PM UTC - 8:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Ash&amp; East Valley Parkway<br>E Valley Pkwy<br>Escondido, CA 92027</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> We The People - Troubled Nation</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Saturday, February 28, 2026
10:00 AM – 12:00 PM
Ash &amp; East Valley Parkway, Escondido

On February 28, our community in Escondido will join people across the country in demanding that businesses and public places take responsibility for what is happening on their premises. We will gather on East Valley Parkway to honor Carlos Roberto Montoya, who was killed during an ICE raid at a commercial location in Southern California, and to stand with all those who have been detained, terrorized, or abducted in and around businesses and public spaces nationwide.
This day of action is our chance to make our voices heard.

Tell Escondido: ICE Out!
Across the United States, ICE agents have been targeting immigrants in and around businesses and public places—stalking parking lots, confronting day laborers, and instilling fear in workers, customers, and surrounding neighborhoods. These raids are chaotic, violent, and too often deadly. In August, in Monrovia near Los Angeles, Carlos Roberto Montoya, a day laborer from Guatemala, lost his life while fleeing an ICE raid. He ran toward the freeway in fear and was struck by a car.

These tragedies are happening on the watch of businesses and public institutions.
On their property.
With their silence.

Too many Escondido businesses have not condemned these raids, have not demanded that the Administration stop targeting people on their premises, and have not taken meaningful steps to protect the workers and community members who rely on these spaces. By refusing to speak out or intervene, they allow their properties to become hunting grounds that feed arrest quotas, private detention centers, and the spread of fear in immigrant communities.

We demand that Escondido businesses and public institutions immediately:
1.	Publicly condemn ICE raids on their property
2.	Prohibit federal immigration enforcement from using their parking lots or public areas to target day laborers or community members
3.	Commit to creating safe, welcoming spaces for all people regardless of status

If anyone is unsafe in these spaces, then we are all unsafe. If businesses and public institutions stay silent, they will be complicit—and they will face not only moral shame, but the loss of trust and support across the U.S. and beyond.

On February 28, Escondido will stand up and say no more.
Join us. Bring your voice, your presence, and your solidarity.
Together we can demand accountability, dignity, and safety for all.

¡ICE Fuera de Escondido – Manifestación Comunitaria!
Sábado, 28 de febrero de 2026
10:00 AM – 12:00 PM
East Valley Parkway, Escondido

El 28 de febrero, nuestra comunidad en Escondido se unirá a personas de todo el país para exigir que los negocios y los espacios públicos asuman responsabilidad por lo que está ocurriendo en sus instalaciones. Nos reuniremos en East Valley Parkway para honrar a Carlos Roberto Montoya, quien murió durante una redada de ICE en un lugar comercial del sur de California, y para solidarizarnos con todas las personas que han sido detenidas, aterrorizadas o secuestradas en negocios y espacios públicos en todo el país.
Este día de acción es nuestra oportunidad para alzar la voz.

¡Escondido dice: ICE Fuera!
En todo Estados Unidos, agentes de ICE han estado atacando a inmigrantes en negocios y espacios públicos—acechando estacionamientos, confrontando a jornaleros e infundiendo miedo en trabajadores, clientes y vecindarios enteros. Estas redadas son caóticas, violentas y con demasiada frecuencia mortales. En agosto, en Monrovia, cerca de Los Ángeles, Carlos Roberto Montoya, un jornalero de Guatemala, perdió la vida mientras huía de una redada de ICE. Corrió hacia la autopista por miedo y fue atropellado por un automóvil.
Estas tragedias están ocurriendo bajo la mirada de negocios e 

instituciones públicas.
En sus propiedades.
Con su silencio.

Demasiados negocios en Escondido no han condenado estas redadas, no han exigido que la Administración deje de atacar a personas en sus instalaciones y no han tomado medidas significativas para proteger a los trabajadores y miembros de la comunidad que dependen de estos espacios. Al negarse a hablar o intervenir, permiten que sus propiedades se conviertan en terrenos de cacería que alimentan cuotas de arrestos, centros de detención privados y la propagación del miedo en las comunidades inmigrantes.

Exigimos que los negocios e instituciones públicas de Escondido:
1.	Condenen públicamente las redadas de ICE en sus propiedades
2.	Prohíban que agentes de inmigración utilicen sus estacionamientos o áreas públicas para atacar a jornaleros o miembros de la comunidad
3.	Se comprometan a crear espacios seguros y acogedores para todas las personas, sin importar su estatus migratorio
Si alguien no está seguro en estos espacios, entonces nadie lo está. Si los negocios y las instituciones públicas permanecen en silencio, serán cómplices—y enfrentarán no solo vergüenza moral, sino también la pérdida de confianza y apoyo en todo el país.

El 28 de febrero, Escondido se levantará para decir basta ya.
Acompáñanos. Trae tu voz, tu presencia y tu solidaridad.
Juntas y juntos podemos exigir responsabilidad, dignidad y seguridad para todas las personas.</p>

        <name>National Day of Lobbying: Impeach, Convict, and Remove ONTARIO, CA (CA-35)</name>
        <description><![CDATA[
<h3>National Day of Lobbying: Impeach, Convict, and Remove ONTARIO, CA (CA-35)</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, February 17, 2026 at 9:00 PM UTC - 10:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Congresswoman Norma J. Torres<br>3200 Inland Empire Blvd 200b<br>Ontario, CA 91764</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> 50501Missouri</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>In the first week of 2026, the administration engaged in three flagrant abuses of power: (1) an unconstitutional military strike in Venezuela, (2) the extrajudicial murder of Renee Nicole Good by a member of the ICE paramilitary force for exercising her first amendment rights, and (3) the continued obstruction of justice for victims of Jeffrey Epstein’s child sex trafficking ring. A month into 2026, the administration has escalated their unchecked aggression against allies like Greenland and countries like Cuba, Columbia, and Mexico. ICE has kidnapped preschoolers and used them as bait for their parents, and the administration is considering deploying military police to back them up.

In short: It’s not getting better and Congress is not meeting the moment. 

Democracy does not defend itself; it requires the active participation of the people. While countless Americans have already called, emailed, written letters, signed petitions, and while activist organizations have brought groups to Capitol Hill calling for impeachment, this moment demands something more visible, more direct, and more powerful: constituents showing up at congressional district offices, where staff rarely, if ever, engage with constituents.

Impeachment is not optional. It is the remedy mandated by the Constitution.

WHO/WHEN:

FLARE USA, Citizens&apos; Impeachment, and 50501 Movement are proud to announce the next National Day of Action: in-district lobbying on February 17, 2026 for the impeachment, conviction, and removal of President Trump. Representatives will be in their districts; catch them at home and demand they use their power to remove this unconstitutional regime!

Grassroots pro-democracy organizations (e.g., local chapters of Indivisible, Hands Off, 50501), progressive primary candidates, and other concerned citizens will join together in leading constituents into the local/in-district offices of all 435 US House Representatives to demand impeachment. 

Please see our attendee guide for more information on why we&apos;re mobilizing, specific goals, current news on impeachment, and a full guide, including scripts, for visiting and following up with your Representative&apos;s office at tinyurl.com/lobby217guide. 

By registering for the event, you are agreeing that event partners may receive your contact information and communicate with you about related activities. 

All participants are committed to lawful, non-violent action and no civil disobedience.</p>

        <name>National Day of Lobbying: Impeach, Convict, Remove, &amp; Defund ICE - March &amp; Lobby [Corona, CA] - CA41</name>
        <description><![CDATA[
<h3>National Day of Lobbying: Impeach, Convict, Remove, &amp; Defund ICE - March &amp; Lobby [Corona, CA] - CA41</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, February 17, 2026 at 6:00 PM UTC - 10:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>City Park<br>930 E 6th St<br>Corona, CA 92879</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> 50501Missouri</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Circle City Solidarity - in partnership with 50501 - brings to the community a beautiful day of making our voice heard to those in local leadership.  This march and display will take place between the hours of 10am and 2pm covering the distance between City Park on 6the St and City Hall. 

In the first week of 2026, the administration engaged in three flagrant abuses of power: (1) an unconstitutional military strike in Venezuela, (2) the extrajudicial murder of Renee Nicole Good by a member of the ICE paramilitary force for exercising her first amendment rights, and (3) the continued obstruction of justice for victims of Jeffrey Epstein’s child sex trafficking ring. A month into 2026, the administration has escalated their unchecked aggression against allies like Greenland and countries like Cuba, Columbia, and Mexico. ICE has kidnapped preschoolers and used them as bait for their parents, and the administration is considering deploying military police to back them up.

In short: It’s not getting better and Congress is not meeting the moment. 

Democracy does not defend itself; it requires the active participation of the people. While countless Americans have already called, emailed, written letters, signed petitions, and while activist organizations have brought groups to Capitol Hill calling for impeachment, this moment demands something more visible, more direct, and more powerful: constituents showing up at congressional district offices, where staff rarely, if ever, engage with constituents.

Impeachment is not optional. It is the remedy mandated by the Constitution. Likewise, Congress holds the power to de-fund and abolish ICE. They aren’t acting because they do not have the political will to do so. So we will lend them some of ours.

WHO/WHEN:

FLARE USA, Citizens&apos; Impeachment, and 50501 Movement are proud to announce the next National Day of Action: in-district lobbying on February 17, 2026 for the impeachment of President Trump and the complete abolishment of ICE. Representatives will be in their districts; it&apos;s time to catch them at home. It&apos;s time to Remove the Regime AND abolish ICE!

Grassroots pro-democracy organizations (e.g., local chapters of Indivisible, Hands Off, 50501), progressive primary candidates, and other concerned citizens will join together in leading constituents into the local/in-district offices of all 435 US House Representatives to demand impeachment and the abolishment of ICE.

<h3>Feet on the Streets - with a twist - tell Home Depot to get I C E out</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Friday, February 13, 2026 at 5:00 PM UTC - 1:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Home Depot near Costco<br>725 Plaza Ct<br>Chula Vista, CA 91910</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>*A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*

Hi Everyone:

I&apos;m trying to think out of the box for ways to utilize Indivisible to organize a lot of Good Trouble ... 

You might have all heard about the badass warriors who made a point of all going to Home Depot to purchase an *ice scraper* with a CREDIT CARD if you can ... and then standing back in line 5 minutes later to return it ... (google it - people are so creative) .

***NEW IDEA***. Same thing, but buy a few screws with your credit card (it adds fees for HD) ... then when you return it a few minutes later, tell the employee to SCREW ICE ... make sure they know the reason you are returning !!!!

Well, how about we all just do that at our own leisure? 

I tried it last week - it was a success, and it made me feel better LOL ...

Here is what you can do ... as often as you can manage it ... work it into your routines if you have to!   I plan on doing it after my protests - on the way home !  

Go to Home Depot ... walk around and &quot;shop&quot; for as long as you want -- I like to go and just PAY ATTENTION -- I now know exactly what they look like from the hotel protests - I hear they like to cosplay as construction workers to fit in!  (they still stick out like a sore thumb in my book).  Have a WHISTLE ready to warn people if you see anything sus .......

Buy California&apos;s version of an &quot;ice scraper &quot;   I bought a small putty knife for 98 cents ...   ***NEW IDEA ... buy a few screws and return them saying SCREW ICE!!!***

PAY by your CREDIT CARD if you can - for extra bonus points (they get charged a fee no matter what is purchased with a credit card -- win win) ...

Then, immediately walk right back in the store and go to the Customer Service line to RETURN it !

I told the nice lady (remember it is NOT the employees fault their employers are not-c&apos;s ...kindness matters), that I was returning this &quot;ice scraper&quot; in solidarity with my friends in the community - to send a message that we do not welcome thugs into our neighborhoods to terrorize our friends!    All with a smile on my face ... she almost cried when she said, I totally understand !!   and happily returned my buck back to my credit card ...

ANYONE can make this happen -- if you are looking for a way to RESIST with us, but being on a street corner is intimidating (no judgment, we all do what we feel comfy with), well THIS little Good Trouble Causing mission is for you!!!

Bonus points if you then post about it on your social media platforms to encourage others to do this simple act!

They shut down a Home Depot (upper Cali) when they had 100&apos;s of people doing this AT THE SAME TIME ...

So, for now, let&apos;s just do it on our own ... whenever you can!

*Next up:  an actual protest in front of that same Home Depot - maybe we can coordinate it to do the ice scraper thing first, and then protest them afterward ... either on the main road, or right in front of their store ...........*

Beeeeeeep

<h3>ICE Out of Home Depot Encinitas</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 28, 2026 at 6:00 PM UTC - 7:30 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>The Home Depot<br>1001 N El Camino Real<br>Encinitas, CA 92024</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> National Day Laborer Organizing Network</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Across the country, ICE agents continue to target immigrants in and around Home Depot stores — workers, customers, and surrounding communities. These raids are chaotic, violent, and sometimes deadly. 

Through its silence and inaction, Home Depot has become ICE’s passive partner. Every raid on its properties deepens fear in our communities. Our nationwide actions showed that people are paying attention — and now we must keep up the pressure.

These atrocities are happening on Home Depot’s watch — on its properties, with its silence Home Depot has become ICE’s complicit partner.

A core principle behind all events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values and to act lawfully at these events. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events</p>

<h3>ICE Out Of Our Communities - San Diego Virtual Teach-in!</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Friday, February 20, 2026 at 1:00 AM UTC - 2:30 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> National Day Laborer Organizing Network</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Join us for an Ice Out Of Our Communities - virtual teach-in for our San Diego communities! 

Today, we are all witness to a crisis of human rights happening in our own cities, as Trump, Ice, and border patrol scapegoat our immigrant neighbors, and weaponize government.  But because people have mobilized and shown up- the tide is turning, and Ice has been exposed for what it is - a very real threat to our safety and civic life.  

Today, people across the U.S., and abroad, are chanting in unison:  ICE OUT OF OUR COMMUNITIES.   And we must know there is MUCH that we can do to get Ice OUT, and help turn the tide from hate to human rights.   

The TEACH-IN will cover:  What does it mean to get Ice OUT from the bottom up?   What can local and state officials do - right now - and how can i get started?  What policies can make a difference that we can lift up and push forward?  

This effort builds on years of organizing led by immigrant communities nationwide — from the fight against 287g contracts to the sanctuary victories that have proven local action works. Cities and states that say NO to ICE are a critical bulwark against mass deportations and the erosion of civil rights.

There is much that we can do locally.  And there is much that our elected officials can do — if we demand courage and leadership.  

Will you join us?</p>

<h3>Tell Target to Break-Up with ICE: Sparks NV</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 14, 2026 at 8:00 PM UTC - 9:30 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>1550 E Lincoln Wy<br>Sparks, NV 89434</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Showing Up for Racial Justice</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>## This Valentine’s Day, Break Up with ICE

Across the country, our communities are under attack. ICE continues to tear families apart — and politicians and corporations like Target are enabling it.

Target has deep roots in Minnesota and enormous influence nationwide. By refusing ICE access and collaboration, Target could choose to stand on the right side of history. Instead, they are currently enabling harm.

This Valentine’s season, we’re asking you to show your love for your neighbors by taking action.

On Wednesday, February 11, SURJ members and partners across the country will take part in Valentine’s Day–themed, nonviolent actions at Target stores to demand that Target break up with ICE — refuse ICE access, stop collaborating, and stop enabling repression in our communities. Our goal is to create a joyful, visible, and disruptive action that calls on Target to take a clear stand against ICE.

This action is rooted in nonviolence, collective care, and solidarity — and you’ll be joining a nationwide movement pushing Target to choose people over oppression.</p>

<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Not My Presidents Day Carlsbad will be a loud, visible action against Trump&apos;s first and second administrations. Trump&apos;s actions were bad in 2017-21.

American citizens, Dreamers, legal immigrants and undocumented immigrants are being killed, injured and imprisoned by ICE. This is part of their broader pattern of unchecked violence, impunity, and abuse.

        <description><![CDATA[
<h3>ICE OUT OF SAN DIEGO</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Thursday, February 12, 2026 at 6:30 PM UTC - 8:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>880 Front St<br>San Diego, CA 92101</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> San Diego &amp; Imperial Counties Labor Council, AFL-CIO</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Across the country, families are feeling the consequences of federal overreach. From attacks on due process and civil liberties to efforts to silence the free press and limit public access to information, these actions threaten the foundation of our democracy.

Everyday people are paying the price while those in power play political games with our rights and freedoms. These are not just policy choices; they are moral decisions that test who we are as a nation and whether we will stand up for justice, truth, and accountability.

Democracy dies in the dark. Now is the time to raise our voices, defend our rights, and demand transparency and fairness from those who claim to lead in our name.

Join us every Thursday outside the Federal Building (880 Front Street, San Diego) to demand that Washington fund care — not chaos. Together, we can send a clear message:

Gather at 10:30am and speaking program begins at 11:00am

• Healthcare is a human right.

• Food is a human right.

• San Diego stands for care, not chaos and cruelty.

This is more than a protest! It’s a stand for dignity, justice, and the right of every family to live free from fear. Bring your friends, your signs, and your voice. Together, we can show that San Diego stands for community, not cages. For more information contact us at cipriano.vargas@sdcounty.ca.gov</p>

<h3>Find Your Furever Valentine: Pet Supply Drive and Adoption Event</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 14, 2026 at 7:00 PM UTC - 2:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Pet Supplies Plus<br>2845 Northtowne Ln<br>Reno, NV 89512</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Biggest Little Action Group</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Find your fur-ever valentine this Valentine’s Day at an adoption event and pet food drive, co-hosted by BLAG and 50501 NNV! Throughout the day from 11am-6pm stop by Pet Supplies Plus to meet some paw-sitively adorably fur babies in need of a loving home, or drop off pet supplies anytime that will be donated to local rescues in need. 
  -  Cat adoption from 11am-3pm, thanks to Feral at Heart Cat Rescue
  -  Dog adoption from 3pm-6pm, thanks to Boxers and Buddies Dog Rescue
  -  Reptile adoption from 3pm-6pm, thanks to MTNGEMZ Reptile Rescue

This event will also bring awareness to the fact that when ICE thugs savagely separate families, this includes pets. After community members are abducted from our streets or from their home, ICE thugs leave pets alone in the car or home, leave them to roam free, tie them to a pole outside, and in some cases beat or shoot pets. Shelters and rescues in cities invaded by ICE are overwhelmed, and animals that have been separated from their families are further traumatized or euthanized due to overcrowding. 

We will provide resources to attendees on how to plan for your pets’ safety in the event of a detainment, and provide information about becoming a foster so animals can stay together until their owners are released from detention. Our pets are our families, too. We hope to see you there!</p>

<h3>Biggest Little Action Group February Planning Meetings</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Thursday, February 19, 2026 at 2:00 AM UTC - 3:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>First Congressional Church of Reno<br>627 Sunnyside Dr<br>Reno, NV 89503</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Biggest Little Action Group</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Join us to discuss alternatives to the usual protests. If you&apos;re tired of standing on sidewalks waving signs at cars, we plan and perform meaningful actions designed to encourage and strengthen each other in opposition to fascism.

Some actions we&apos;ve done this year include displaying portraits of the victims of ICE disappearances at the federal courthouse and at Reno&apos;s baseball stadium; creating and distributing Know Your Rights information to interstate passengers on Greyhound and Amtrak; calling for citizens to make public comment at the Board of Commissioners meeting to testify against the cooperation between ICE and the county jail; and organizing opposition to the local Republican congressman and his reluctance to hold a town hall. We&apos;re also the people responsible for displaying antifascist messages over I-80 during rush hour. Some of our individual members are involved in community defense networks like ICE Response and Court Accompaniment. We do as much as we can and welcome new ideas and new members all the time.

We are nonviolent and non-vandalizing. We work in support of democracy and the Constitution, and against the fascist actions of the Trump administration, its supporters, and its enablers. Everyone can play a role in this fight. Come and see if you like our style.</p>

<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>**Join us** on the corner of Aliso Creek Rd. and Enterprise to uphold our Constitution and fight the oligarchy trying to take over America. We&apos;ve evolved from **Tesla Takedown!** to a weekly, peaceful, family-friendly rally in defense of our rights and with aspirations for a Democracy that includes **ALL** people.

We meet every Saturday, 11am-12:30pm, rain or shine!

We&apos;re collecting mutual aid to share with our neighbors via South County Outreach. **[Please see the list of needed items here](https://www.sco-oc.org/get-involved/feed-our-community/)**.

Meet on the grass at the the corner of Aliso Creek Rd. &amp; Enterprise. Park in the theater lot, near the old Macaroni Grill, and take the ramp down to the corner. This is a fun event with music, lots of great like-minded people with whom to build community, and many supportive passers-by (lots of honks &amp; waves!)

### WHAT TO BRING: ###

- your signs (please keep your messages family-friendly)
- food and essential items for mutual aid (see above)
- flags of all kinds
- water/hydration for you and (optionally) to share
- (optional) packaged snacks to share
- a folding chair if you prefer to sit

<h3>Protest Every Monday in Brea</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, February 17, 2026 at 1:00 AM UTC - 2:30 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>The Busiest Intersection in Brea<br>Imperial Highway &amp; State College Boulevard<br>Brea, CA 92821</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>## Join INDIVISIBLE CA-45 in Brea for a high visibility **PEACEFUL protest**

### RAIN CANCELS - Rain on the windshield and on the road and dark of night is a dangerous combination at the busiest intersection in Brea.

#### We will rally on every corner of the intersection of Imperial Highway and State College Boulevard in Brea, CA 92821. During rush hour, many thousands of cars will be passing by.

Some new safety guidelines starting November 3rd:
1.	 Do not cross streets unless absolutely necessary.  Select a corner for the rally and stay there.  (This is for your safety, as when it is dark drivers cannot see you as well. All of our close-calls have been with people crossing the street.)
2.	Remain behind the tape placed along the curb.
3.	For your signs to be more easily seen and read – please use white posters with black or dark lettering. (The artwork is pretty, but more difficult to see in the dark!)
4.	Try to stay in well lit areas.  Wear light colored clothing.

### Protest for Democracy, the Rule Of Law, and **FREEDOM OF SPEECH**

## Protest against the brutality of ICE !!!

### Bring your signs

### Bring your flags.

## BRING YOUR COSTUME!

# Please be safe!

**DO NOT PARK anywhere in the shopping area on the southwest corner of Imperial and State College.** Southeast and Northeast corners are best.

This a local Indivisible event!
**A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to _DE-ESCALATE_ any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.**</p>

<h3>Whittier Indivisible Chapter Weekly Strategy Meeting</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Friday, February 13, 2026 at 3:30 AM UTC - 4:30 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Come one, come all! We are the Whittier Indivisible Chapter, and we meet weekly on Zoom to discuss, share, plan, and listen. We engage in local, in-person efforts in our community as well as national initiatives. The majority of our members are from surrounding cities in addition to Whittier, CA. 

This a local Indivisible event! We strictly abide by and follow Indivisible leadership and protocol, and do not tolerate any behavior that is disrespectful, discriminating, or hateful in any way. 

Whittier Indivisible is a Southern California-based grassroots group committed to defending democracy, resisting authoritarianism, and standing up for the dignity and rights of all people—documented or undocumented. Rooted in Whittier and welcoming to all from surrounding communities, we are proudly pro-immigrant and oppose ICE overreach, racism, and any policy that dehumanizes or divides. We believe all people—regardless of immigration status, race, gender, disability, faith, or identity—have inherent worth, value, and dignity, and are entitled to the rights guaranteed by the Constitution, including due process, free speech, and equal protection under the law. We advocate for social and economic justice, environmental protection, and individual freedoms, while standing firmly against fascism and authoritarianism in all forms. As a community, we practice gracious and respectful communication, and value inclusivity, accessibility, diversity, equity, honesty, kindness, and ambition in our organizing. We believe strong, compassionate local action can create a more just, democratic, and sustainable future for all.

*A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*

<h3>Whistlemania! LBC: Neighborhood Folding Event at Sports Basement</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Friday, February 27, 2026 at 1:30 AM UTC - 3:30 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Sports Basement Long Beach<br>2100 N Bellflower Blvd<br>Long Beach, CA 90815</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Long Beach Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>This event in the community space upstairs at Sports Basement, check with the front desk or follow signs to find us. 

Fold zines, make whistle packs with us, and learn about how to become more involved in the opposition.

We saw the reports of Chicago residents coming together with indignant spirit and whistles around their necks to care for their neighbors and KICK ICE OUT. Following that lead, our Whistlemania! LBC goal is to put 16,000 whistle packs into the hands of Long Beach residents during the next 3 months as a sign of dissent and solidarity.

YOU CAN HELP.

No time to sit and fold? This is also a great time to pick up whistle packs for you and your co-workers, your social club or your extended family (while supplies last). https://linktr.ee/whistlemanialbc

Despite terrible national news and the ongoing harm ICE is doing in our city, don’t let helplessness and despair set in.

Join us, we’ve got work to do!

<h3>Whistlemania! LBC: Neighborhood Folding Event at Watch Me</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Friday, February 20, 2026 at 2:00 AM UTC - 4:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Watch Me! Sports Bar<br>6527 E Pacific Coast Hwy Unit B-2<br>Long Beach, CA 90803</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Long Beach Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Join us at Watch Me! Sports Bar to fold zines, make whistle packs with us, and learn about how to become more involved in the opposition. They are not charging us for the use of the space and have asked that we purchase drinks or food to help support them. 

We saw the reports of Chicago residents coming together with indignant spirit and whistles around their necks to care for their neighbors and KICK ICE OUT. Following that lead, our Whistlemania! LBC goal is to put 16,000 whistle packs into the hands of Long Beach residents during the next 3 months as a sign of dissent and solidarity.

YOU CAN HELP.

No time to sit and fold? This is also a great time to pick up whistle packs for you and your co-workers, your social club or your extended family (while supplies last). https://linktr.ee/whistlemanialbc

Despite terrible national news and the ongoing harm ICE is doing in our city, don’t let helplessness and despair set in.

Join us, we’ve got work to do!

A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.</p>

<h3>CIVIC SUNDAYS + BOYCOTT HOME DEPOT COALITION  ICE BREAKER -SHOW UP, DO SOMETHING - IN PERSON!</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Sunday, February 22, 2026 at 11:00 PM UTC - 1:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br><br>Los Angeles, CA 90028</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Civic Sundays</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Civic Sundays, in conjunction with Boycott Home Depot Coalition is planning an BOYCOTT HOME DEPOT ABOLISH ICE action at Home Depot the weekend of Feb 22, and we need your participation!  

L.A. is a car culture, and we hope to use that against them.  Unlike most, the Home Depot we&apos;re highlighting has limited parking, and, with your help, WE are going to fill their parking lots!  

Once we have accomplished that, we&apos;ll be picketing the parking lot entrances, entering the store to buy &amp; return Ice Scrapers ($1.08 each).  We will keep paying customers out, and we will jam their cashiers with transactions that make them zero profit.  

Sign up so we know how many cars/people we can count on and coordinate our action!

Thanks for showing up and doing something!</p>

We’ll talk Black futures during Black History Month, how the #Olympics and gentrification are reshaping our city, and the real issues hitting our community, including mental health, housing, homelessness, education, and the ongoing threat of ICE and state violence.

If you care about protecting Black lives and building strategies that move us forward, we need you there. RSVP and bring your people.

<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>✊ Weekly Saturdays Actions — ALL OF IT. ANY OF.IT... We push back + Solidarity Visibility Brigade.  We are building momentum for *NO KINGS* on *March 28th*.  We are building community.

This Week on Sat FEB. 7th. demanding ICE OUT OF EVERYWHERE, Honoring A. Pretti, R. Good, Hands Off Venezuela, No ilegal wars, respect internarional law, - RELEASE ALL THE EPSTEIN FILES,  AFFORDABILITY, DEMOCRACY, DUE PROCESS, cuz we ain&apos;t buying the stories either.  ALL OF IT ... 

Indivisible CA27 is mobilizing EVERY SATURDAY [and sometimes SUNDAYS] and on purpose.

We’re joining cities across the country to continue to protest against ICE, in solidarity with MN, Protest Home DEPORT, Spotify, all of them - all of it!  

We stand with the Venezuelan community for a Free Venezuela - with due process and congressional approval for a LEGAL, forceful, decisive stand.  NO ILEGAL WARS!!  A stand against The Tyrant Maduro Regime but not manipulated by the Trump Tyrant Regime either.   

RELEASE ALL THE EPSTEIN FILES, Affordability, Healthcare; All of it. 

We continue in support of the national blackouts and boycotts extending them all thru 2026 — a coordinated action using economic power to push back against corporate and political systems that enable injustice.  Non-Violent pushback works.

Come and protest for all the reasons you may have.  No time to stay silent.

We’ll gather for a non-violent visibility protest to amplify the message locally and demonstrate that Santa Clarita is awake, engaged, and unafraid to show up.

📅 Date: Every Saturday during 2026 and beyond...
⏰ Time: 10:30 AM – 1:00 PM. or 2:00 PM - Check the listings below.
📍 Location: Necessary Trouble Corner

Corner of Valencia Blvd. &amp; McBean Parkway

Signs (or borrow)

Water and comfort essentials

Your voice and your presence

This is a weekly response — showing the power of a community ready to act constantly when needed.

If you cannot attend in person, you can still make an impact by amplifying posts from the national campaign on social media and sharing coverage with your network.

Let’s remind corporations, elected officials, and the community:
our power goes far beyond the ballot — we control where we put our dollars, our attention, and our bodies.

See you at the corner.

A core principle behind all Indivisible and 50501 events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.

        <name>National Day of Lobbying: Impeach, Convict, Remove, and Defund ICE - SANTA CLARITA iCA27</name>
        <description><![CDATA[
<h3>National Day of Lobbying: Impeach, Convict, Remove, and Defund ICE - SANTA CLARITA iCA27</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, February 17, 2026 at 3:00 PM UTC - 11:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Rep. George Whitesides Office CA27<br>27200 Tourney Rd<br>Santa Clarita, CA 91355</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> 50501Missouri</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>In the first week of 2026, the administration engaged in three flagrant abuses of power: (1) an unconstitutional military strike in Venezuela, (2) the extrajudicial murder of Renee Nicole Good by a member of the ICE paramilitary force for exercising her first amendment rights, and (3) the continued obstruction of justice for victims of Jeffrey Epstein’s child sex trafficking ring. A month into 2026, the administration has escalated their unchecked aggression against allies like Greenland and countries like Cuba, Columbia, and Mexico. ICE has kidnapped preschoolers and used them as bait for their parents, and the administration is considering deploying military police to back them up.

In short: It’s not getting better and Congress is not meeting the moment. 

Democracy does not defend itself; it requires the active participation of the people. While countless Americans have already called, emailed, written letters, signed petitions, and while activist organizations have brought groups to Capitol Hill calling for impeachment, this moment demands something more visible, more direct, and more powerful: constituents showing up at congressional district offices, where staff rarely, if ever, engage with constituents.

Impeachment is not optional. It is the remedy mandated by the Constitution. Likewise, Congress holds the power to de-fund and abolish ICE. They aren’t acting because they do not have the political will to do so. So we will lend them some of ours.

WHO/WHEN:

INDIVISIBLE CA27 in Santa Clarita with FLARE USA, Citizens&apos; Impeachment, and 50501 Movement Nationally, are proud to announce the next National Day of Action: in-district CA27 lobbying on February 17, 2026 for the impeachment of President Trump, Noem, Miller &amp; Bondi and the complete abolishment of ICE. Representatives will be in their districts; it&apos;s time to catch them at home. It&apos;s time to Remove the Regime AND abolish ICE!

On February 17th, at 2 pm.  At the office of Rep. George Whitesides.

WHAT:  We will show up, we will give him 2 petition letters signed by District CA27 constituents.

1. First petition dated January 18th, 2026 - with updated signatures collected to date.  (Rep Whitesides has already received a first copy of this petition and we are awaiting a response, including a date certain for a TOWN HALL).  
🔗 SIGN THE PETITION: [PETITION] (https://secure.ngpvan.com/o1HxHvf22EWFm4AlhUVDOw2)

2. Complimentary petition with the Impeachment and Abolish ICE request.
LINK TO BE PROVIDED SHORTLY.

NOTE:  We are waiting for response regarding our TOWN HALL DATE.  If we do not hear from him by February 17th, we will invite him to a date Certain Town Hall that we are setting up 

Grassroots pro-democracy organizations (e.g., local chapters of Indivisible, Hands Off, 50501), progressive primary candidates, and other concerned citizens will join together in leading constituents into the local/in-district offices of all 435 US House Representatives to demand impeachment and the abolishment of ICE. 

By registering for the event, you are agreeing that event partners may receive your contact information and communicate with you about related activities. 

All participants are committed to lawful, non-violent action and no civil disobedience.

Between foreign invasions, trade wars, and vilification of our allies, they are damaging America&apos;s place in the world.  And their use of ICE to attack innocent civilians is criminal and in support of an unabashed agenda of white supremacy and nativism.

The training will be about the most effective ways we can fight this as individuals, along with the power of working in groups and coalitions.  We&apos;ll discuss best practices for protests, rallies, and boycotts; best approaches to contacting elected representatives; and ways to make a difference in competitive elections.

This will be an interactive session, where we can talk together and practice effective tactics.  Please join us!</p>

        <name>ICE Out Whistle Kit Assembly Event</name>
        <description><![CDATA[
<h3>ICE Out Whistle Kit Assembly Event</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Wednesday, March 4, 2026 at 2:00 AM UTC - 4:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Torrance Municipal Airport - Zamperini Field<br>3301 Airport Dr<br>Torrance, CA 90505</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible South Bay LA</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>ICE and CBP are terrorizing neighborhoods around the country. Let&apos;s get together and prepare, so that we can help our friends and neighbors in case they decide to target the LA area again. The key to disrupting their operations is to Get Loud and Form A Crowd, and to take lots of videos.

Please join us in assembling Whistle Kits that we can distribute to attendees at our events. Each kit will include: 
1) 1 whistle for people to use if ICE shows up in their neighborhoods
2) 5 know-your-rights red cards to give to people who might be at risk
3) 2 flyers for businesses to post stating that a judicial warrant is needed for entry and law enforcement operations
4) General instructions on how to use the kit
5) Instructions on the best way to resist ICE operations

We&apos;ll have snacks and light beverages, and discuss some things we can do to get ourselves ready.</p>

<h3>Whistle Kit Making Party with Indivisible Eastside</h3>

<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Together Center<br>16305 NE 87th St<br>Redmond, WA 98052</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>## Join Indivisible Eastside in blowing the whistle on ICE!

Whistle Kit making parties are a community safety practice rooted in resistance movements in LA and Chicago to help alert neighbors during immigration raids.

On **1st &amp; 3rd Tuesdays of the month** we get together to learn, build, connect, and strengthen our collective safety network. In moments like these, we’re reminded that __protection is not just a policy, it’s a community responsibility.__

The most important thing to bring is yourself! 

We are 100% grassroots, volunteer-led and funded. If you’d like to help us offset costs, we can accept online contributions at https://bit.ly/IE-Donate-W, or can provide an alternative method. *This event is free. No contribution is required.*

If you&apos;re unable to attend but would like to contribute materials, you can **drop whistles or kit supplies off at the [Together Center](https://togethercenter.org/$0) front desk, where we now have a whistle drop!** (16305 NE 87th Street, Redmond WA 98052)

*A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*</p>

<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 14, 2026 at 7:00 PM UTC - 8:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Bellevue Way Northeast &amp; Northeast 4th Street<br>Bellevue, WA 98004</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Exercise your free speech - while you still have it. Join Indivisible Eastside members in their ongoing protest of the harmful administration&apos;s policies every Saturday.

Downtown Bellevue at the corner of Bellevue Way and NE 8th St. Do not block sidewalks or roads. No walk off parking at the Bellevue Square Mall.

Hosted by Indivisible Eastside

On Wednesday, January 7th, an American citizen was killed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Minneapolis, Minnesota. This killing is part of a broader pattern of unchecked violence, impunity, and abuse carried out by federal immigration enforcement agencies against members of our communities.

We must stand up and send the strong message of ICE OUT FOR GOOD until ICE is out for good.

A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action and no civil disobedience. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values, and to act lawfully at these events. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events.

<h3>Tell Target to Break-Up with ICE: Seattle (South)</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 14, 2026 at 6:30 PM UTC - 9:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Parking lot OPPOSITE target, near Corner Bakery Cafe<br>393A Strander Blvd<br>Tukwila, WA 98188</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Showing Up for Racial Justice</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>## This Valentine’s Day, Break Up with ICE

Across the country, our communities are under attack. ICE continues to tear families apart — and politicians and corporations like Target are enabling it.

Target has deep roots in Minnesota and enormous influence nationwide. By refusing ICE access and collaboration, Target could choose to stand on the right side of history. Instead, they are currently enabling harm.

This Valentine’s season, we’re asking you to show your love for your neighbors by taking action.

This week, SURJ members and partners across the country will take part in Valentine’s Day–themed, nonviolent actions at Target stores to demand that Target break up with ICE — refuse ICE access, stop collaborating, and stop enabling repression in our communities. Our goal is to create a joyful, visible, and disruptive action that calls on Target to take a clear stand against ICE.

This action is rooted in nonviolence, collective care, and solidarity — and you’ll be joining a nationwide movement pushing Target to choose people over oppression.</p>

<h3>We Love Our Neighbors - ICE OUT OF TARGET</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Sunday, February 15, 2026 at 1:00 AM UTC - 2:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Target<br>301 Strander Blvd<br>Tukwila, WA 98188</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Southend Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Sponsored by Indivisible Covington, MLK Labor, Seattle Indivisible, SEIU 775, Southeast Seattle Indivisible, Southend Indivisible, and West Seattle Indivisible.

Join this powerful coalition of unions and Indivisible groups to gather peacefully outside and in front of Southcenter Target on Valentine&apos;s Day to express love for our neighbors, mourn the many lives lost at the hands of ICE/CBP/DHS, and demand that Target stop capitulating and cooperating with ICE/CBP/DHS and the fascist Trump regime.

THE PLAN: We will gather peacefully and quietly at 5 pm, pass around candles (already supplied) and a couple people will hold up just a few intentionally-messaged signs - one displaying the names of the many precious lives taken, and a few highlighting Target&apos;s harming communities and their own employees by cooperating with ICE and to demand they keep ICE out of their stores and parking lots. No need to bring anything. The sun sets at 5:30 pm. 

We will NOT be holding rally signs (this is not a rally, it is a quiet memorial and a simple demand with pre-made, lit up signs already being brought and held). We will NOT be blocking any streets or walkways, entries or exits for people or cars. We will NOT be chanting - we will stand in silence.

Target may ask us to leave. The optics of their asking a group of quiet people holding candles and not in anyone&apos;s way to leave will be on them. If they demand that we leave, we may move to the heavily trafficked entrance to the parking lot and stand on the sidewalk.

Why Target?

What is happening in Minnesota wouldn&apos;t be possible without the complicity or enablement of Trump&apos;s corporate backers. Despite countless immigrant families ripped apart, American citizens killed in our streets, many corporations continue to support him, refusing to take a stand with our communities and frequently directly supporting ICE. We are standing up to stop this regime of terror. To win, we need companies like Target to use their influence to force the administration to end the occupation of our cities, and not bring their chaos anywhere else.

Target is letting ICE assault and abduct its employees and use its parking lot to stage raids on immigrant communities in ICE-occupied MN and increasingly everywhere else. 

Target&apos;s compliance with ICE is matched by the company&apos;s collusion with the un-American MAGA agenda. It donated $1,000,000 to Trump’s inauguration, rolled back DEI initiatives, cut support for Black employees and businesses, and removed LGBTQ+ products from their stores. Witnesses have reported Target regularly allows ICE to stage operations in its parking lots. On Thursday, January 8th, Customs and Border Patrol assaulted and kidnapped two U.S. citizens while they were working a shift at the Richfield, MN Target store.

Target is Minnesota’s 4th largest employer in the state. Minnesota’s sports teams play in stadiums and jerseys with Target’s logo on them. Where Target leads, others follow. In solidarity with Minnesota, we will demand that Target stand with Americans against the public executions in our community and the continued attacks on our neighbors.

Our Demands:

1) Publicly call for an immediate end to the ICE “surge” into MN and for ICE &amp; Border Patrol to leave the state.

2) Affirm Target as a 4th Amendment Workplace. Demand Target exercise their 4th Amendment rights and publicly post signage denying entrance to immigration agents who do not have signed judicial warrants as required by law, as well as train staff on how to respond when immigration agents arrive at stores.

3) Publicly call to shut down Trump’s ICE. Lobby congress to cut funding for ICE in the upcoming Congressional budget and ICE should be investigated for human and Constitutional violations of the rights of Americans and our neighbors.

4) Demand any federal officer who kills or harms a civilian be held legally accountable. That starts with legitimate investigations and charges by local officials. 

We recognize and honor the incredible work done by the Target Boycott Campaign regarding the company’s removal of DEI initiatives and are in solidarity with the work of the local leaders in Minnesota leading that effort. We support the ongoing boycott, which continues until their demands are met.</p>

<h3>Time to Act 2026!</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Sunday, February 15, 2026 at 8:00 PM UTC - 9:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Swing Left</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>It’s 2026—and Democracy is on the line. Will you step up and take action to help preserve our hard-won democratic norms freedoms, before they are crippled beyond repair?

You’ve seen the immense damage that Trump and MAGA have already done. They followed Project 2025 very closely (despite Trump disavowing it before the 2024 election), and now they want more. Venezuela. Greenland. ICE shootings in Minneapolis, Portland, and ______(?). Attacking opponents left and right. It’s downright scary.

And there’s more on the agenda… including possibly trying to cancel or invalidate the 2026 election.

**Not. On. Our. Watch.**

2026 is also the year we **Fight Back,** and we NEED YOUR HELP. Please join us for an upcoming Time to Act training with Seattle Supports Democracy/Swing Left Seattle.

In this one-hour Zoom session, we’ll teach you how to:

   -Take effective action to protect democracy (at whatever level you choose, from calling your reps and writing letters to direct action in the streets, and more).
    -Counter the anti-immigration agenda of the Trump administration and protect our friends and neighbors with different types of strategies.
    -Help register voters, turn them out to vote, and preserve free and fair elections for all.

We believe in taking positive action joyful (we find it&apos;s the best antidote for despair). We’ll help you identify the values and issues that are motivating you to speak out, then give you the skills and strategic knowledge to do it.

Past attendee Lisa F. said, &quot;This was an excellent training--organized, clear, and positive. I left inspired, and with a specific idea of the actions I wanted to take.&quot;

At Seattle Supports Democracy, we&apos;ve trained thousands of individuals over the last five years, activating them and helping them write letters, send texts, make calls, help others, and show up to defend our democratic freedoms and make their voices heard. Join the movement!</p>

<h3>JUSTICE FOR GOOD. ABOLISH ICE: Lynnwood</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 14, 2026 at 8:00 PM UTC - 10:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Tesla Lynnwood<br>17731 Pacific Hwy<br>Lynnwood, WA 98037</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Seattle Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Renee Good deserves justice and we won&apos;t stand silently while her murder is covered up. Join our protest in honor of Renee and in solidarity with immigrant communities across the United States. 

**Trump&apos;s devastating cuts to Medicare and other critical programs so he can give massive tax breaks to billionaires are unconscionable.**Join us in protesting the attack on our rights, the plundering of our country, **and the billionaire who made it all possible.**

Our protests have helped force Musk from DC but our work is far from done. Tesla&apos;s stock is UP because investors think we&apos;re going to fade away. That&apos;s not going to happen.

**Without Musk&apos;s backing, Trump wouldn&apos;t be president and we wouldn&apos;t have to fear for the future of our country. Our democracy has never faced someone with so much money and so little shame as Elon Musk and he&apos;ll remain a danger until we take Tesla&apos;s stock to single digits.**

Please, join us. We need your voice. Let&apos;s make some noise!

See you Saturday!

<h3>Seattle - Impeach, Convict, and Remove - Lobby, Rally, &amp; March (WA-07)</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, February 17, 2026 at 10:00 PM UTC - 12:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>1701 Broadway<br>Seattle, WA 98122</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> 50501Missouri</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>In the first week of 2026, the administration engaged in three flagrant abuses of power: 
(1) an unconstitutional military strike in Venezuela, 
(2) the extrajudicial murder of Renee Nicole Good Alex Pretti by members of the ICE paramilitary force for exercising their first amendment rights 
(3) the continued obstruction of justice for victims of Jeffrey Epstein’s child sex trafficking ring. A month into 2026, the administration has escalated their unchecked aggression against allies like Greenland and countries like Cuba, Columbia, and Mexico. ICE has kidnapped preschoolers and used them as bait for their parents, and the administration is considering deploying military police to back them up.

In short: It’s not getting better and Congress is not meeting the moment. 

Democracy does not defend itself; it requires the active participation of the people. 
All participants are committed to lawful, non-violent action and no civil disobedience.</p>

<h3>Hey Target: Love Your Neighbor, Melt Your Heart – ICE OUT!</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Sunday, February 15, 2026 at 10:00 PM UTC - 12:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Hubbard Homestead Park (meet across from Target)<br>11203 5th Ave NE<br>Seattle, WA 98125</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> North Seattle Progressives</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>🎯 Tell Northgate Target to stand up to ICE!

⏱️ When: Sunday, February 15th (the day after Valentine’s Day) at 2pm

🗺️ Where: Meet at Hubbard Homestead Park, north of the Northgate Target

❓Why: Tell Target that their support of ICE is breaking our heart! 💔 We love our neighbors and demand that Target stands up to ICE’s reign of terror. ❌🧊

🎒Bring: Signs addressing Target, your voice, and some friends! Dress for the weather.

Why Target?
Target is headquartered in Minneapolis. As the 3rd largest employer in Minnesota, they’re a key decision maker in the state. That’s why it was painful to see that…

— Target donated $1,000,000 to Trump’s inauguration. 💰

— When Trump sent thousands of masked agents into the state to assault, kidnap, and kill people, Target refused to speak out. 🤐

— When ICE staged operations in Target parking lots and kidnapped Target employees, the corporation did nothing. 😡

As sales drop in response to DEI rollbacks and customers are increasingly angry, Target is starting to feel the pressure. Join us at Northgate Target to make sure Target hears us loud and clear! 🎯📣

We demand that Target

🔴 Publicly call for an immediate end to the ICE “surge” into Minnesota, and for ICE &amp; Border Patrol to leave the state.

🔴 Affirm Target as a 4th Amendment Workplace. (Publicly post signage denying entrance to immigration agents without a signed judicial warrant, and train staff on how to respond when immigration agents arrive at stores.)

🔴 Publicly call to shut down Trump’s ICE. Lobby congress to withhold federal funding for ICE in the upcoming budget; and for congress to investigate ICE for violations of the human and constitutional rights of our neighbors.

🔴 Demand that any federal officer who kills or harms a civilian be held legally accountable. That starts with legitimate investigations and charges by local officials.


🎨 If you’re feeling artsy, here are some sign ideas!
— Love your neighbors - ICE OUT
— Target supports ICE
— Target: Stand Up to ICE terror
— Target donated to Trump
— Break up with Target
— Target broke my heart
— No love for Target
— Have a heart, Target


A core principle behind this event is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events.</p>

<h3>Whistle Kit Assembly Parties</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Wednesday, February 18, 2026 at 1:00 AM UTC - 3:30 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Des Moines United Methodist Church<br>22225 9th Ave S<br>Des Moines, WA 98198</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>The Whistle Kit Assembly Parties sponsored by Des Moines Indivisible and Seniors for the Constitution have been a huge success. The kits contain a whistle, a small zine with instructions, and a Know Your Rights card. The purpose is to give people a non-violent, legal way to use their voices.  If someone sees ICE activity in the neighborhood, blowing the whistle alerts others to be aware, stay safe, and if possible, stay loud and form a crowd.

<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Big Catch Plaza<br>21640 Marine View Dr S<br>Des Moines, WA 98198</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Seniors for the Constitution was organized by seniors insisting that their voice also be heard. When we organized in February, 2025, we quickly learned that Des Moines WA Indivisible was also being organized. We all agreed we should be collaborating on everything possible. While they hold Wednesday rallies, Seniors for the Constitution holds rallies on the 1st and 3rd Saturdays of the month from noon to 2 p.m. Big Catch Plaza is a great place to gather for our family-friendly, peaceful rallies. Approximately 1600 people attended our first “No Kings” rally. Even more attended our second “No Kings” rally. The Waterland Blog (local news) frequently features our rallies. We are determined to appear on Rachel Maddow. Please join us and make YOUR voice heard as well. Our current emphasis is dismantling ICE and putting an end to the killing and terror ICE has brought upon the people of America.

<h3>Washington for All: Sign up for ICE Mobilization Alerts</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Wednesday, October 29, 2025 at 7:00 AM UTC - 8:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Washington Indivisible Network</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>## **Washington is home. We belong here.**

Working people build Washington. Whether we&apos;re picking apples in the Yakima Valley, fishing on the coast, milling lumber in Aberdeen, raising a family in Tacoma, or running small businesses in Seattle, we&apos;ve earned the right to feel safe and respected in the place we call home.

But, just like in LA &amp; Chicago, the Trump Administration has promised to keep terrorizing cities across America via increased ICE tactical units, mass raids, and deploying the National Guard,  including right here in Washington State. They want us to believe some of us don’t belong here by spreading hate and division. But who really doesn’t belong on our streets? Masked agents who are tearing apart our communities through violence instead of safety.

Trump and his billionaire backers don’t get to decide who belongs in our state. We do.

We are preparing for a variety of scenarios across our state in the event that they escalate their efforts to turn our government into a weapon against our people.

Sign up to know when it’s time for Washingtonians to come together to protect one another.

**We are standing with one purpose**: Together, we will train, organize, and communicate our shared commitment to a free and safe Washington for all.

In preparation, together we will: 

* Train on de-escalation and strategic non-cooperation   
* Make and distribute whistle kits for community defense   
* Distribute information so businesses and individuals know their legal rights

When it&apos;s time to mobilize, we will: 

* Mobilize a unified response
* Advocate for real solutions that meet our needs - like fully-funding our schools, creating good jobs and making healthcare affordable - not wasting our time and money to harass our neighbors
* Focus attention on the ICE violating our rights

### **SIGN UP FOR MOBILIZATION ALERTS &amp; SPREAD THE WORD**

### **We need all hands on deck. Washington thrives when all of us can live without fear, and our success does not come at the expense of others. This is our shared fight.**

A core value of Washington for All is a commitment to nonviolent action.</p>

<h3>In-Person Lunchtime Meeting w/ Sen. Cantwell&apos;s Staff</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Wednesday, September 9, 2026 at 8:00 PM UTC - 8:45 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Federal Office Building<br><br>Seattle, WA 98104</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Seattle Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p># Join Seattle Indivisible for a Critical Discussion with Senator Cantwell&apos;s Staff

Join Seattle Indivisible for an engaging Zoom discussion and Q&amp;A session with staff from Senator Maria Cantwell&apos;s office. As we navigate a complex political landscape in 2025, several key issues demand our attention:

Key Issues in 2026
🧊 Paramilitary Forces Attacking Immigrants and our Cities
ICE and CPB waging illegal, violent campaigns against immigrants and Black and brown people. 


🏛️ Constitutional Concerns
The ongoing failure of institutions to protect our rights and programs established by Congress have raised serious questions about the erosion of democratic principles.

💰 Economic Uncertainty
The imposition of a federal spending freeze has led to confusion and legal challenges, impacting various programs and contributing to fiscal instability.

⚖️ Social Equity
Policies targeting marginalized communities, including restrictions on transgender rights and potential cuts to social safety nets, underscore the ongoing struggle for social justice.

Senator Cantwell has been a vocal advocate for protecting democratic institutions, promoting economic stability, and advancing social equity. This session offers a unique opportunity to engage directly with her staff on these pressing issues.

📢 Your participation is crucial in voicing concerns and influencing decisions that impact our community.

We look forward to your active involvement in shaping the future of our state and nation!</p>

<h3>Amazon: Dump ICE!</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Friday, February 13, 2026 at 9:00 PM UTC - 10:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>The Spheres<br>2111 7th Ave<br>Seattle, WA 98121</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Seattle Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) has contracts with both ICE and CBP—and hosts more government repression via its partnership with Palantir and Ring camera&apos;s link with Flock surveillance. On the day Alex Pretti was murdered, in the same week that Amazon laid off 16,000 people, CEO Andy Jassy attended a private gala screening of the Melania premiere (having spent $75 million on the movie). Seattle and Washington deserve better: our hometown company should benefit the people, not the MAGA authoritarian oligarchy who are terrorizing our neighbors.

Come tell Amazon: Dump ICE!


Co-sponsored by Troublemakers, Washington for All, 350 Seattle, and Southend Indivisible.</p>

<h3>HONK &amp; WAVE PROTEST: ICE OUT FOR GOOD &amp; PRETTI</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 14, 2026 at 6:00 PM UTC - 7:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Wood Village Center<br>NE 223rd Avenue &amp; NE Glisan Street<br>Wood Village, OR 97060</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Multnomah East Indivisible Group</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>HONK &amp; WAVE - ICE OUT FOR GOOD &amp; PRETTI

ALL SATURDAYS IN FEBRUARY:  7th, 14th, 21st, 28th.
THIS IS A 1 HOUR POP-UP PROTEST 10AM-11:00AM
RAIN OR SHINE - DRESS FOR THE WEATHER.

Join Multnomah East Indivisible (MEI) community members from Gresham, Wood Village, Troutdale, Fairview, Corbett!
We will meet at the Wood Village Shopping center.

Gather at the intersection of NE Glisan Street and NE 223rd on the NE Corner, protest along the public sidewalk.

This is a visibility protest not a rally or march. Bring your Signs!

We stand with Minnesotans and our fellow citizens across America.
Everyday we see and hear about those who are being kidnapped, beaten and kept in cages, moved far from their families. These citizens are denied due process that is guaranteed under our US laws. 
These folks are not criminals, they are people in our communities who are being denied basic human civil rights.

We have seen ICE &quot;Agents&quot; murder Good and Pretti and we have learned of the deaths of 38 other citizens at the hands of ICE.
 ICE &quot;agents&quot; operate within a broad pattern of unchecked violence, impunity, and abuse. This is unconstitutional, this is criminal and this is being carried out by federal immigration enforcement &quot;agents&quot; against members of our communities.  

We Stand with our Immigrant Families! Bring your signs, bring a friend, and meet fellow resistors. Stand up and Defend Democracy!  

Remind yourself of your rights as a protester here:

https://www.aclu.org/know-your-rights/protesters-rights

A core principle behind all ICE Out For Good events is a commitment to nonviolent action and no civil disobedience. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values, and to act lawfully at these events. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events.</p>

Which one or two of these topics are you passionate about?
Consider picking one to stay informed and join with others.

There will be an opportunity at the meeting to meet together and make plans.

✴️ The following Groups would love for you to join them 

Each topic is an umbrella topic, meaning there are many actions that need attention in each group. Join a group, speak up and get your idea supported. Bring your research, ask questions, find out how you can get involved at your comfort level. 

1.  Neighbor to neighbor food drives
Helpline/KIAC Food donations picked up in neighborhoods. This offers an opportunity to get your neighbors involved and informed of ways they can help.

<h3>Screw ICE! Lets get ICE out of Home Depot.</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 14, 2026 at 10:00 PM UTC - 12:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>The Home Depot<br>10120 SE Washington St<br>Portland, OR 97216</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Outer East Portland Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>*Outside the Home Depot where our neighbors gather to seek an honest day’s work, we will hold signs and flags for those who&apos;ve been taken, abused, and killed by ICE. Every worker’s life matters, and together we demand justice for all.*

### Join us for a honk and wave visibility event at the Mall 205 Home Depot as part of the national Disappeared In America campaign. ###

#### We&apos;re showing up all, across the country to speak out against the collaboration between corporations and ICE that has led to the detention, abuse, and deaths of immigrant workers. In a series of strategic actions - organzing, flyering, and buy-ins, everyday shoppers can engage in this defiance. ####

These “ICE Out of Home Depot” actions honor workers like Carlos Roberto Montoya, who lost his life while fleeing an ICE raid in Monrovia, California, and countless others who have faced harassment, racial profiling, and violence simply for seeking honest work. 

#### We call on Home Depot and other corporations to stop enabling policies that endanger immigrant workers and tear families apart communities will stand together in peaceful but firm resistance, demanding safety, solidarity and justice for all who labor.

Indivisibles are committed to non-violence as a guiding principle in everything we do. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values</p>

<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Support Folsom High School students on their walk out and Rally!
* High school students in Folsom, CA are invited to participate in a school walkout and protest against ICE! This is a student-led event, that is NOT affiliated with our schools! We are requesting that other high school students join our movement, but we would also appreciate support from experienced adults to help monitor the protest, and ensure students are safe. Thank you!
* We&apos;re walking out of our schools at 10:00 AM, and walking down to John Kemp Community Park (40 min walk), where we&apos;re hosting our Art Advocacy Rally to showcase student art, speeches, and poetry. This rally aims to put student voices, many of whom bring lived experience as children of immigrants, at the forefront of change, to demand justice and equality.

<h3>Good Trouble Saturday - ICE OUT for Good!</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 14, 2026 at 8:00 PM UTC - 9:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>3500 E 4th Plain Blvd<br>Vancouver, WA 98661</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Greater Vancouver</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>✊ GOOD TROUBLE SATURDAYS ✊

Join Indivisible Greater Vancouver (IGV) and MoveOn–Clark County
We’re turning up the volume on justice every Saturday — standing together in solidarity with our neighbors and against the rising tide of ICE-fueled intimidation in our community.
Inspired by civil rights icon John Lewis, our weekly rallies are now Good Trouble Rallies — peaceful, non-violent actions rooted in love, courage, and the belief that we keep each other safe. We show up because our community deserves to live free from fear, harassment, and authoritarian overreach.
Location:
📍 E Fourth Plain Blvd &amp; Wilson Ave
On the south side of Evergreen Park and in the heart of Vancouver’s vibrant Latin community — and an area where we’ve seen an alarming increase in ICE presence and unjust detentions. We show up to say: Not on our watch.
🕓 Saturdays, 12–1 PM
🪧 Bring:
Your signs, your noisemakers, and your voice.
Some parking is available at Evergreen Park or in the surrounding neighborhood.
🗣️ Let’s send a clear message:
We protect each other. We stand with our immigrant neighbors. We reject authoritarianism in all forms.
Join us in making some Good Trouble — because our community deserves safety, dignity, and a government that works for the people, not one that terrorizes them.</p>

Wednesdays
📍 Vancouver Central Park
2199 E Fourth Plain, Vancouver, WA
Join Indivisible Greater Vancouver (IGV) as we provide visibility to community support for our immigrant neighbors and rally within Vancouver’s International District. This intersection has seen heightened ICE activity and abductions. We are showing up—peacefully, visibly, and together—to say:
NO to ICE brutality.
NO to lawlessness.
YES to community care and immigrant dignity.
✊ Bring your signs, your voice, and your solidarity.
💛 Let our neighbors know they are not alone.
When communities show up, fear loses its grip.

About Indivisible Greater Vancouver (IGV) - https://www.indivisiblegreatervancouver.org
Indivisible Greater Vancouver (IGV) is committed to promoting nonviolent advocacy and activism to create lasting social and political change. Founded in 2017 as a chapter of the national Indivisible movement to resist the Trump agenda, IGV has since expanded its focus to include local and Washington state grassroots organizing.
We work in partnership with organizations that share our values, including Clark County 50501, MoveOn Clark County, LULAC, Pasitos Gigantes, and the Vancouver chapter of the NAACP. Together, we build community power rooted in justice, equity, and solidarity.
IGV is deeply committed to nonviolence as both a principle and a strategy. We at IGV strongly believe that peaceful, nonviolent activism offers social movements the most power to effect change. Through peaceful protests, we set an example of making our voices heard with dignity, empowered by truth. IGV does not condone intimidation, threats, vandalism, interference with access to business or any other lawless actions. If instigators or opponents attempt to violate our commitment to non-violence, we will try to de-escalate and end the event if needed to maintain a safe environment.
You can read more about Indivisible’s national commitment to nonviolence here:
🔗 indivisible.org/commitment-nonviolence
We also value and are guided by the research of Dr. Erica Chenoweth, whose work shows that nonviolent movements are significantly more successful than violent ones in achieving lasting social and political transformation:
🔗 Paths to Resistance – Harvard Kennedy School
Together, we stand strong, peaceful, and resolute—because nonviolence is not passive. It is powerful.</p>

<h3>Frog umbrellas and fellowship at the Winter Light Festival</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 14, 2026 at 2:00 AM UTC - 4:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Pioneer Square&apos;s statue of an umbrella man<br>701 SW 6th Ave, Portland, OR 97204<br>Portland, OR 97204</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Outer East Portland Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Join some fellow Indivisibles at the Winter Light Festival downtown (pdxwlf.com for details). This is just a social event where we can meet, talk, and enjoy the festival exhibits together. We&apos;ll stick together in one or two groups and pick which exhibits to see depending on the group&apos;s interests and ability. 

The focus of this event is showing off 6 umbrellas that look like the inflatable frog costumes They&apos;re hand-made and janky but a lot of fun. They light up and glow so they&apos;ll complement the festival. We should look good as a party of 6+ people with these matching umbrellas! It will spread a little protest spirit to the hundreds of festival attendees who see us there.

We won&apos;t spread any stronger political message that clashes with the light happy festival atmosphere. The illuminated protest frog image works here, but this event is NOT for sending any strident messages. Indivisible shirts and buttons are OK, but leave the ICE OUT and NO KINGS signs at home. 

Come on out and join us! Let&apos;s see the sights and be seen at this huge fun gathering.</p>

We’re building a movement of young people to force this country to work for our generation. We will stop the authoritarian takeover, end billionaire control of our politics, and win an affordable, liveable future for all of us. 

We’re starting by building the power for non-cooperation - so that we can stop the authoritarian takeover of this country. In 2028, we’ll escalate to mass strikes and disruption that force Donald Trump out of power and call for a new political and economic system that works for all of us. In 2029, we’ll end the billionaire-control of our political system system and have a government run by and for everyday people - so that we can pass laws that can stop the climate crisis and make life affordable for all. 

### Sunrise is youth led
Sunrise is movement led by young people under the age of 35. This is to address the reality that young people often have less agency in society and we believe we should get a say in shaping our futures. All our work is coordinated by young people but everyone is welcome to participate in Sunrise trainings, canvasses, actions, and events. 

Sunrise has big plans, locally and nationally, and our new world can’t come to be without YOU.</p>

<h3>Anti-ICE Target Buy-In Protest</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Sunday, February 15, 2026 at 9:00 PM UTC - 10:30 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>665 Sleater Kinney Rd SE<br>Lacey, WA 98503</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Northwest Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Who wants to get out and do something other than a sign wave? We are organizing the Buy-In process at Target this weekend (Sunday, Feb 15th @ 1pm) and we would LOVE your help. It is being organized by the National Immigration Project in Minneapolis and it is happening this week all over the country. 

We plan to have everyone wearing identical signs (we will provide them) while they walk in, buy some salt (to melt ICE) then immediately return the salt at the Target Returns desk.  This should attract some attention with some long line and generate questions since we are all wearing a sign! We will have written talking points for everyone about how Target is supporting ICE so all of us can educate the customers and even the employees. We will have a letter for the manager as well.  If you have been following the Minneapolis efforts you may know that Target is a major supporter of Trump &amp; ICE. Minneapolis is asking for help pushing back.

Who wants to get out of the house and have some fun?

Email us at  info@NorthwestIndivisible.org  with your questions.

<h3>Canby: Day Without an Immigrant</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Monday, February 16, 2026 at 8:00 PM UTC - 10:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>S Ivy St and 99E<br>Canby, OR 97013</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Join us for a sign waving event to show support for the vulnerable members of our community. Let them know they are not alone.

Location: along 99E between S Ivy St and S Grant St in Canby, OR.
Time: Monday, February 16th, 2026  from 12pm-2pm.
Parking available at Zoar Lutheran Church 190 SW 3rd Ave, Canby, OR 97013.

Endorsed by Bridging Cultures/Puentes Entre Culturas.

From PCUN (Oregon&apos;s Farmworker Union):
Immigrant workers are the backbone of Oregon&apos;s most important sectors. We came here following the American dream, and to build a better life for our families. We work the jobs nobody else will do. They are backbreaking, low-paid, and sometimes dangerous. We helped make this country the richest country in the world. We&apos;re not criminals, we&apos;re families, workers, PEOPLE!

We have seen an overwhelming increase in ICE and Border Patrol in our communities, terrorizing our children, destabilizing our local business, harming our community. We have something Trump and his cronies want, our labor, our money, our time.

No work. No shopping. No school. Join our cause!

Our goal is to get ICE Out of our barrios by building solidarity amongst allies and immigrant workers. We need other sectors to stand up against gestapo immigration enforcement, and find real solutions to our broken immigration system.

What Happens on a Day Without An Immigrant? We&apos;re asking YOU to take the day off of work, and NOT participate economically. A Day Without An Immigrant is for all sectors of the economy.

On February 16th, 2026 we want you to join Day Without An Immigrant in cities across the state. Thanks for your support!

This a local Indivisible event!

*A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*</p>

<h3>ICE OUT for Good</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 14, 2026 at 9:00 PM UTC - 10:30 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>5698 SW Canyon Ct<br>Portland, OR 97221</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Stand Up For the Truth</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Protest can feel pointless, tiresome and lonely, but it&apos;s a crucial step in building a community network that can withstand the regime&apos;s assaults.

ICE will disappear your neighbors and they will kill you. Then the regime will slander you and investigate your family. Minneapolis stood up and we can too. This revolting gang of fascists is playing for all the marbles.  Murder and kidnapping are just the beginning. The aim is subjugation and ICE is trump&apos;s own brown shirt army. It&apos;s time to stand up!

Join us most Saturdays from 1:00 to 2:30 or come at 12:30 to help set up. And bring a friend, a neighbor, your whole posse!</p>

<h3>Friday Function in the Junction</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Friday, February 13, 2026 at 11:30 PM UTC - 12:30 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Skyway &amp; Neal Road<br>Paradise, CA 95969</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>“Get in good trouble, necessary trouble, and help redeem the soul of America.” - John Lewis

During Friday Function in the Junction, bring American flags, if you have them. Wear bright colored clothing, bring your choice of resistance posters.

We will push the crosswalk button. After the first row of cars come to a complete stop, we will cross Skyway together inside the crosswalk. Then let cars go by, as we wait for our turn to again cross Skyway.

If you don’t feel comfortable walking, or just want to come out for support, feel free to bring a chair and enjoy the protest music.

To make car honking be your friend, bring a sign to encourage honking, such as:

“Honk for Peace”
“Honk in memory of Renee Good (or Alex Pretti)
“Honk to stop ICE
“Honk for Remaining Epstein Files

MAGA or not, these are our neighbors in a small community, so be kind. If drivers wish to argue, wish them a good evening.

*A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*</p>

<h3>No Ice, No Troops in Beaverton, Oregon</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Wednesday, February 18, 2026 at 11:30 PM UTC - 12:30 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>6125 SW Hall Blvd<br>Beaverton, OR 97008</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>We are getting an enthusiastic response, and people asked if we are going to do it again! So we are! ICE have been seen all over Washington County, including Beaverton, quite a bit in the past several weeks. We don’t want them here; all of our neighbors belong. And we do not need or want federal troops in Oregon. There is no invasion, no insurrection. We are peaceful protesters exercising our Constitutional right of free speech by saying no to ICE, no to federal troops including the National Guard. We are thanking our local law enforcement for doing their job and remembering that Oregon is a sanctuary state, where police are not cooperating with ICE. And we are peaceful. Bring your friends and neighbors and signs and chants, and music. Indivisible Beaverton is hosting this event. All are welcome.
  Please note time change as the days get darker to 3:30-4:30.

<h3>Demand McClintock Defend the Constitution - National Day of Lobbying</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, February 17, 2026 at 10:00 PM UTC - 11:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>McClintock&apos;s Modesto Office<br>1020 15th St<br>Modesto, CA 95354</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> 50501 California</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>It&apos;s been one heck of a year! We&apos;ve seen flagrant violations of the constitution by this administration, in many areas. This is not normal politics. This is not simply disagreements in how government should run. 

Let&apos;s join together and let McClintock know how we feel on this National Day of Lobbying. Our main messages are: impeach Trump, abolish ICE, defend the constitution. Other relevant topics include:
- repeated violations of the constitution by the Trump administration
- reckless abuse of power by DHS &amp; ICE, resulting in deaths of American citizens
- human rights violations in ICE detention facilities
- majority of ICE arrests have no criminal record
- our allies have been treated disrespectfully and have been turned into adversaries
- tariffs have not been effective &amp; a Times investigation shows 96% of tariff costs are paid by the US consumer
- failure to abide by the Epstein Transparency Act &amp; an apparent continued coverup of Epstein files
- healthcare costs
- violation of the emoluments clause with Trump&apos;s business dealings and doubling his personal wealth since taking office
- the US continued support of the genocide against the Palestinian people. We must stop funding, and providing weapons to Israel.

We will request to speak to McClintock&apos;s staff, most likely in small groups. You will have the opportunity to ask a question and share your concerns.</p>

<h3>NOT MY PRESIDENT - SHELTON</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 14, 2026 at 7:00 PM UTC - 9:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Kneeland Park<br>100 Turner Ave<br>Shelton, WA 98584</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>NOT MY PRESIDENT – SHELTON, WA
STAND UP, GET UP…JOIN US!
KEEP UP YOUR SUSTAINED, NON-VIOLENT, PEACEFUL OPPOSITION TO THIS FASCIST REGIME

Federal agents have killed yet another person in Minneapolis.  Everything about ICE and Border Patrol’s brutal invasion of our communities is horrific.  We had 185 patriots at the Port of Hoodsport on January 24th expressing our horror at the events of the last year and especially the events of the last few weeks.  These attacks cannot go unanswered and must not become “normalized.” 

Our coalition of patriots opposed to this fascist regime are again asking everyone to peacefully come together and say we demand better — from our institutions and our leaders.  Out of the ashes of WWI and WWII, We The People, worked and sacrificed over the last eighty years to build a future of promise for everyday folks.  This future was built on the backs of Americans and international forces who were wounded in so many ways, or died, believing their individual sacrifice was saving democratic values, the rule of law, adherence to our constitution, and a government of the people, by the people and for the people.

Whether you see the current president as an authoritarian, a wanna be king, a malevolent, corrupt aggressor bent on destroying our democratic values to gain power, or, that he is simply unfit to lead, the message is the same: this is not the leadership we want representing our country or shaping our future. Period.  We have had a year of the chaos and it has only brought us a corrupt government NOT of the people, by the people or for the people, but a regime structured to benefit the billionaires and oligarchs who want everything for themselves, and it’s even better yet if they get it all at the expense of the people.  And now, they have escalated the killing of patriots in the streets who exercise their first amendment rights. We must peacefully and non-violently demonstrate to all that every life matters and we stand proudly and patriotically in opposition to their crimes.

If you believe in accountability, democracy, and a government that answers to the people, join us. Show up, stand together, speak out and make it clear that while Trump may hold office for now, he and his fascist sycophants are not the President or government we want or deserve.  Every single day we resolve to take action to uphold our constitution and defy this regime’s brutal attacks.  NOTE:  You can stay connected to local actions through Concerned Citizens of Mason County’s weekly informational email, at CCMCI2025@gmail.com. 

IMPORTANT DETAILS FOR NOT MY PRESIDENT BELOW…

NURTURE YOUR POSITIVE ENERGY! Let’s commend ourselves that after a year of horrific attacks, we are diabolically opposed to the crimes of this President and his sycophant government, and are standing strong, in unison, to defy their assaults on humanity. Together we peacefully and patriotically raise our voices in opposition.  We will not shut up; we will stand up. Bring friends with you to exercise their constitutional rights as well! Action and hope are contagious! See you there!

WE SUPPORT OUR COMMUNITY THROUGH FOOD AND SCHOOL SUPPLY DRIVES: IF YOU ARE ABLE, please bring NON-PERISHABLE FOOD and SCHOOL SUPPLIES to donate to our local food banks and school children. Donations accepted under the canopy on the lawn and at the tables at each end of the park sidewalk. Many in our communities rightfully live in fear of illegal ICE activities and our families are being torn apart because of that. Thank you for helping your neighbors.  

SAFETY: We are first and foremost a non-violent movement. Should verbal abuse be directed at us, we do not engage in a disrespectful way. We do not escalate rhetoric toward violence, we de-escalate. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values and to act lawfully, and respectfully, at these events. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events.

The Shelton Police Department has been notified of our peaceful protest. You may see them cruise by on the highway and/or park in the area. As well, our local team of Peacekeepers wearing yellow/orange vests will be in place to assist. Seek them out if you need assistance of any kind.

We will line up along the Kneeland Park sidewalk of Hwy 3. Please be considerate of pedestrians and do not lean into traffic or step off the curb into the bike lane. Please do not cross, or stand on, the opposite side of Hwy 3.  Restrooms are available in the park.  

There will be bottled water, first aid support and a few chairs under the canopy on the lawn if you need a respite. 

PLAN FOR THE WEATHER: We are encouraging all able-bodied allies in possession of rain gear (and who isn’t in the PNW?!) to join us.  Bring your water and snacks to stay energized.  What a fabulous witness it will be for our communities to see a band of die-hard protestors rallying against this evil regime despite the weather. Courage begets Courage.

PARKING: Please carpool if you can. Parking is very limited along Kneeland Park. Additional parking is across Turner Avenue way up behind the Shelton Athletic Club and along neighboring streets. Let’s be good neighbors and not block any driveways.

OUR COALITION OF PARTNERS ACROSS MASON COUNTY, AND BEYOND, LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING YOU: Concerned Citizens of Mason County Indivisible, the 35th Legislative District Democrats, Mason County Democrats, the Mason County Women Democrats, Belfair for Democracy, Independent Americans Opposed to Dictatorship, Dems in the Hood, and Union Indivisible. 

A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values</p>

Join us this Sunday, 12–2 PM, at 36th &amp; Broadway!

This is the moment.
This is the line in the sand.

Project 2025 is already giving ICE cover to act outside legal limits — escalating force, detaining people without cause, and terrorizing families in broad daylight. We refuse to normalize this. We refuse to stay silent. We show up to demand accountability, transparency, and safety for our communities.

Bring your voice.
Bring your signs.
Bring your courage.

See you at 36th &amp; Broadway — visible, loud, and united.</p>

<h3>Day Without an Immigrant</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Monday, February 16, 2026 at 7:00 PM UTC - 9:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> PCUN (Oregon&apos;s Farmworker Union)</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Join us on February 16th from 11am-1pm for our next Day Without an Immigrant visibility action! 

We will be doing a sidewalk march in front of our State Capitol in support of our immigrant neighbors. 

Immigrant workers are the backbone of Oregon&apos;s most important sectors. We came here following the American dream, and to build a better life for our families. We work the jobs nobody else will do. They are backbreaking, low-paid, and sometimes dangerous. We helped make this country wealthy.

We have seen an overwhelming increase in ICE and Border Patrol in our communities, terrorizing our children, destabilizing our local business, harming our community. We have something Trump and his cronies want, our labor, our money, our time. 

No work. No shopping. No school. Join our cause!
Our goal is to get ICE Out of our barrios by building solidarity amongst allies and immigrant workers. We need other sectors to stand up against gestapo immigration enforcement, and find real solutions to our broken immigration system. 

What Happens on a Day Without An Immigrant? We&apos;re asking YOU to take the day off of work, and NOT participate economically. A Day Without An Immigrant is for all sectors of the economy. On the days identified below we will send opportunities to join Day Without An Immigrant in cities across the state. Thanks for your support!</p>

<h3>Letter to Mayor Kaarin Knudsen and Eugene City Council - State of Emergency</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Wednesday, January 21, 2026 at 8:00 AM UTC - 8:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Eugene - Springfield</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>### Oregon cities are writing to government officials to direct them to stand against federal immigration practices by declaring a state of emergency in Eugene over ICE enforcement that has raised intense fears. Let the state of Oregon stand in solidarity with it’s cities standing up to ICE and federal agents. 
_______________________________________________________________________________

Oregon cities are taking action as Federal agents have arrested or detained people without due process, refused to share reasons for arrests they make and questioned people about their immigration status based on race, ethnicity, accent or job, according to the declaration. And legitimate law enforcement officers do not wear masks. **Ever.**  

* **Raids target workplaces:** businesses in hospitality (restaurants, car washes, bakeries), construction, agriculture (farms, meatpacking, poultry), and retail (like Home Depot).                                                                                              
* **Educational Institutions**                                                                                                               
* **Healthcare &amp; Sensitive Locations:** Recent enforcement has included hospitals, schools, and places of worship, people in their cars and peaceful protesters.     
                                                                                                                                                        
Salem, Woodburn, Hillsborough, and Washington County are stepping up to protect the rights of the people. **“Our diversity is our strength, and we will never waiver from our commitment to serve every person who lives here with dignity.”**

Woodburn **residents and business owners** described downtown Woodburn as a &quot;ghost town&quot;  in the wake of the arrests. Officials estimated 50% to 80% fewer people were walking around the city&apos;s center.  “Keeping families together and children protected and safe is a fundamental value for Oregon cities.” 

ICE agents are arrested for alleged criminal acts like assault, violating civil rights through unlawful searches/seizures engaging in misconduct, or potentially committing crimes while on duty. 

We the undersigned, as Oregonians, and as Americans, hereby demand you add Eugene‘s declaration of a state of emergency ASAP to arrest ICE and federal agents that break the law, to the list of other Oregon cities. 

Respectfully and in Solidarity, 


The undersigned</p>

<h3>ICE Out of SLO County! Abolish ICE!</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Sunday, February 15, 2026 at 6:00 PM UTC - 7:30 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>California 1 &amp; Kansas Avenue<br>San Luis Obispo County, CA 93405</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Rally and vigil every Sunday between 10 am - 11:30 am at the corner of Hwy 1 and Kansas Avenue. Join us for a rally to protest ICE activity in our beloved community and to hold vigil for those in our community abducted by ICE. The sheriff chooses to allow ICE agents into the jail to abduct people despite CA laws that would allow him not to cooperate. The sheriff says he transferred zero people to ICE from January 2018 to December 2024. However, he reports 69 transfers in the secure area of the jail for 2025. These transfers do not include ICE abducting people released into the jail lobby which happens routinely. 

It IS happening here! ICE is in our community multiple times a week abducting people from the SLO County jail. Imagine you are waiting for a loved one to be released from the SLO county jail.  But before you can be reunited with them, they are kidnapped by masked secret police from the jail right before your eyes.

People taken at the jail are being denied due process and legal representation. They are separated from their children, families and loved ones. Don&apos;t turn your back on what is happening in our community. Everyone who is released from the jail should be released regardless of where they were born.

Thanks to those who spoke up at the Truth Act Forum on January 27 and those who showed up in solidarity. A subcommitee taking 60 days to dither is insufficient! At least 30 people can be kidnapped from the jail in that time. 

Bring large signs and banners centering calls for abolishing ICE and keeping it out of SLO and everywhere. If featuring signs with names of people murdered by ICE, please list all the people murdered by ICE. And the countless people harmed and disappeared whose names we do not know. Please stay off the road and stay safe.

<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Vacaville City Hall<br>650 Merchant St<br>Vacaville, CA 95688</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Save our Democracy/ICE OUT
History is watching. Right now, our country faces critical challenges: ICE accountability, protecting voting rights from federal takeover through the SAVE Act, and defending the democratic principles we have taken for granted. Our country is in a constitutional crisis. It&apos;s time to take back our Democracy. We need to rise up and let our voices be heard.
Do this today: Invite three friends, call, text, email
Bring your creative signs and unstoppable spirit
Wear comfortable shoes and a camp chair if needed
Bring water, stay hydrated and a fully charge phone
The Golden rule: Keep it Peaceful. We are committed to non-violence.  Stay focused on the message. No stepping into the street or jay walking, the sidewalk is our stage. Our strength is in our unity and our values.
Do not engage with any agitators- don&apos;t take the bait!
Quick heads up - no public restrooms available, so plan accordingly.
History will ask: Where were you when democracy needed you most?
Let your answer be: I SHOWED UP.
Your presence and your voice matters!




*A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*</p>

<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 14, 2026 at 8:00 PM UTC - 10:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Sidewalk on NW Stewart Parkway (In Front of Stewart Parkway Medical Building)<br>2460 NW Stewart Pkwy<br>Roseburg, OR 97471</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p># 🛑 RALLY AGAINST THE REGIME

## A Weekly Saturday Protest Against Authoritarianism

**Hosted by:** Indivisible Douglas County

**Date:** Every Saturday (some exceptions for the holidays)

**Time:** 12:00 pm to 2:00 pm

**Location:** 2460 NW Stewart Pkwy, Roseburg, OR 97471 (the sidewalk in front of Stewart Parkway Medical Building, across the street from McDonald&apos;s and Big O Tires)

⸻

## ✊ WHY WE RALLY

This is a weekly, sustained protest against the accelerating rise of authoritarian rule, state violence, and systemic corruption under the Trump administration.

We are rallying to confront:

- The construction of an authoritarian state that uses fear, surveillance, and force to silence dissent

- The mass targeting, criminalization, and disappearance of immigrants and vulnerable citizens carried out by the Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)

- The normalization of corruption, abuse of power, and rule-by-decree governance

- The genocide that continues to this day in Gaza and the West Bank under the ongoing military campaign by Israel against the Palestinian people, aided by the United States

This rally is about one core truth:

- Human rights do not depend on citizenship.

- Human dignity does not stop at borders.

- Democracy cannot survive corruption and terror.

⸻

## 🎯 WHAT WE ARE DEMANDING

We are calling for:

- An end to ICE and DHS being used as political weapons to terrorize our immigrant communities

- The abolition of ICE activity in the United States

- Full protection of due process, asylum rights, and constitutional liberties for all people within our borders

- An end to authoritarian governance, political repression, and state intimidation

- An immediate end to U.S. complicity in Israel’s genocide against the Palestinian people

- Real accountability for corruption, war crimes, and abuse of power—at every level

⸻

## 👥 WHO THIS RALLY IS FOR

- Immigrants, refugees, and their allies

- The Palestinian people and supporters of Palestinian liberation

- Veterans, faith leaders, workers, students, parents, and elders

- Whistleblowers, organizers, human rights defenders

- Anyone who refuses to live under authoritarian rule or corruption by the Trump administration

- Anyone against authoritarianism, fascism, and the abuse of power

- You do not have to be an activist.

- You just have to care about human lives and democratic freedom.

⸻

## 🕊 SAFETY, DISCIPLINE &amp; NONVIOLENCE

This is a peaceful, nonviolent protest, and that means:

- Everyone is responsible for their own de-escalation, as a safety team may not be available for every protest

- Do not take the bait of those who wish to antagonize us or our movement, disengage or remove yourself from conflict

- No physical engagement with counter-protesters

- No weapons of any kind

⸻

## 🪧 WHAT TO BRING

- Signs, banners, flags

- Justice-centered, anti-authoritarian, pro-human-rights messages

- Weather-appropriate clothing

- Water, sunscreen, medication

<h3>Tri-Valley Signs of Solidarity: Business Canvassing</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, February 17, 2026 at 9:30 PM UTC - 11:30 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Koffee Time<br>618 Main Street, Suite A, Pleasanton, CA 94566<br>Pleasanton, CA 94566</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Tri-Valley</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Join the Signs of Solidarity team to canvass local businesses, and ask them to post signs of support for our immigrant neighbors. 

There&apos;s been a significant increase in ICE agents entering small businesses without warrants and detaining people, including workers. It&apos;s created an environment where immigrants are often afraid to go to work or go shopping out of fear that ICE might show up. That&apos;s not how anyone in our community wants to live. Businesses should take steps to protect their workers and customers from these increasingly violent raids. 

No experience is necessary. A script is provided and a packet of signs; please bring a bag to carry them. You will receive a brief training and will be paired with an experienced canvasser. Please join us and and help to be part of the solution!

PLEASE NOTE: WE PLAN TO CANVASS IN MULTIPLE LOCATIONS IN THE TRI-VALLEY STARTING IN PLEASANTON ON JANUARY 27; HOWEVER, THE LOCATIONS WILL CHANGE WEEK TO WEEK.</p>

WHISTLES - A COMMUNITY SAFETY UPDATE
We love everyone&apos;s enthusiasm with their various noise-makers but note that whistles are now used for ICE warnings. In order to avoid undue fear, confusion or panic for our communities, please refrain from using whistles hereafter for any protest events.  Bells and horns are alternatives. 

Fight back against the Trump Regime and the extremist budget cuts, kidnappings by masked goons, and attempted military take-over of our cities, cuts to Medicaid and Medicare. Due Process for all! People over profit! Billionaires should not rule America. ICE/Military out of our communities! Bring your own sign!

These are nonviolent events. Each of us is responsible for our own conduct. Stay within your rights, don’t break laws, stay safe, stay peaceful, and avoid any risk you don’t feel comfortable with. Don’t obstruct traffic, protest inside any business, impede people from entering or exiting any property, or commit any acts of property damage. Ignore any counter protestors and stay focused on peacefully delivering our message. If you need help or see something troubling, tell a uniformed police officer or call 911. If you can safely do so, record troublesome behavior with your phone, as this is often a strong deterrent to bad behavior.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
<h3>National Day of Lobbying: Impeach, Convict, Remove - San Jose, CA-18</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, February 17, 2026 at 9:00 PM UTC - 11:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>San Jose Zoe Lofgren<br>635 N First St Ste B<br>San Jose, CA 95112</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> 50501Missouri</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>In the first week of 2026, the administration engaged in three flagrant abuses of power: (1) an unconstitutional military strike in Venezuela, (2) the extrajudicial murder of Renee Nicole Good by a member of the ICE paramilitary force for exercising her first amendment rights, and (3) the continued obstruction of justice for victims of Jeffrey Epstein’s child sex trafficking ring. A month into 2026, the administration has escalated their unchecked aggression against allies like Greenland and countries like Cuba, Columbia, and Mexico. ICE has kidnapped preschoolers and used them as bait for their parents, and the administration is considering deploying military police to back them up.

In short: It’s not getting better and Congress is not meeting the moment. 

Democracy does not defend itself; it requires the active participation of the people. While countless Americans have already called, emailed, written letters, signed petitions, and while activist organizations have brought groups to Capitol Hill calling for impeachment, this moment demands something more visible, more direct, and more powerful: constituents showing up at congressional district offices, where staff rarely, if ever, engage with constituents.

Impeachment is not optional. It is the remedy mandated by the Constitution. Likewise, Congress holds the power to de-fund and abolish ICE. They aren’t acting because they do not have the political will to do so. So we will lend them some of ours.

WHO/WHEN:

FLARE USA, Citizens&apos; Impeachment, and 50501 Movement are proud to announce the next National Day of Action: in-district lobbying on February 17, 2026 for the impeachment of President Trump and the complete abolishment of ICE. Representatives will be in their districts; it&apos;s time to catch them at home. It&apos;s time to Remove the Regime AND abolish ICE!

Grassroots pro-democracy organizations (e.g., local chapters of Indivisible, Hands Off, 50501), progressive primary candidates, and other concerned citizens will join together in leading constituents into the local/in-district offices of all 435 US House Representatives to demand impeachment and the abolishment of ICE. 

Please see our attendee guide for more information on why we&apos;re mobilizing, specific goals, current news on impeachment, and a full guide, including scripts, for visiting and following up with your Representative&apos;s office at tinyurl.com/lobby217guide. 

By registering for the event, you are agreeing that event partners may receive your contact information and communicate with you about related activities. 

All participants are committed to lawful, non-violent action and no civil disobedience.</p>

<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Eagle Park<br>650 Franklin St<br>Mountain View, CA 94041</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> It&apos;s Blue Turn</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Join us in the park for a **hands-on organizing fair** where you can meet our teams, try out different kinds of action, and find the role that fits you best This is for **everyone**, whether you’re brand-new and still figuring out “Where do I start?” or you’ve been volunteering for years and might be ready to try a new lane.

You’ll rotate through short, interactive stations hosted by different teams in our group: voter outreach, protest and visibility work, immigrant-justice /community action against ICE harassment, education and training, and more. At each stop you’ll **do** something small: a bite-sized practice activity or mini-training that gives you a feel for that kind of work.

 Our hope is that you leave having met new people, learned a few concrete skills, and found at least one team you’d like to plug into more deeply this year.  

Come as you are, bring a friend if you can, and experiment! See you in the park!</p>

<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>The New Parkway Theater<br>474 24th St<br>Oakland, CA 94612</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> RefuseFascism.org</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Sir! No Sir! vividly takes you inside the rebellion that spread among the US military in Vietnam. This was a big part of forcing the US to end that war. This history lesson has largely been erased from public memory.

This film speaks with powerful resonance to totday, when the fascist Trump regime has sent troops to American cities to suppress widespread public opposition to the cruel ICE kidnappings, deportations and cold blooded murder. He&apos;s sent military to attack Venezuela and threatens to send soliders to oppress more countries and people. 

Will solders carry out illegitmate, unconstitutional and immoral orders of this regime? Or will they refuse?

<h3>ICE Breaker - Rally for Immigrant Rights</h3>

<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Courthouse Square<br>2200 Broadway<br>Redwood City, CA 94063</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> The Wolves</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>ICE is a masked, undemocratic secret police force that gives due process the finger and answers only to Donald Trump.

We will not stand by and do nothing while they disappear our community members, leaving nothing but trauma and despair behind. Let&apos;s show everyone in Redwood City and San Mateo County that we stand with our immigrant brothers and sisters in their time of need and we will resist ICE with everything we have.

We&apos;ll meet at Courthouse Square and march through Redwood City. Bring your signs and bring the noise!

This is a peaceful, non-violent protest. We are there to raise awareness, make our voices heard, and have fun. Everything else is none of our business.</p>

<h3>Indivisible San Mateo:  Saturday lunch at Terrace Dining at Hillsdale Mall</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 14, 2026 at 7:30 PM UTC - 8:30 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Hillsdale Shopping Center<br>60 31st Ave<br>San Mateo, CA 94403</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> IndivisibleSan Mateo</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Please join Indivisible San Mateo&apos;s Mary Beavins and Rick Moody for conversation and conviviality and a no-host lunch at the Terrace Dining area at Hillsdale Mall in San Mateo on Saturdays, from 11:30 to 12:45 p.m.

The lunch is open to everyone connected with Indivisible San Mateo and will take place prior to our weekly Saturday street protests from 1 to 2:30 p.m., around the corner on El Camino at East 31st Avenue.  On the street, we&apos;ll be enjoying not only the very popular music of The Freedom Strummers but also the company of pro-democracy friends and the cacophonous sounds of solidarity from the passing honking horns.

The Terrace Dining area is on the second floor at the north end of the Mall, accessible by escalator and elevator.  There&apos;s ample parking at the Mall, lots of seating and lots of lunch options for those dining at one of the places in the food court.  The restaurants include Sarku Japan; Tacos E. Grullens; Hakata Kuro Obi Ramen; and Panda Express, among others.  There is also a Haagen-Dazs ice cream shop there.

Reservations are not necessary and all are welcome, whether for lunch or dessert or just fellowship for members of Indivisible San Mateo.  All are encouraged to be part of the rally afterward on El Camino around the corner.</p>

<h3>Resist Fascism with Bannering 101 Burlingame</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Thursday, February 12, 2026 at 11:30 PM UTC - 1:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Bayside Crossing Overpass/Bayside Park on Airport Blvd<br>1125 Airport Blvd.<br>Burlingame, CA 94010</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p># High Visibility demonstration on Hwy 101 overpass

Bannering 101 is a group of concerned citizens who display banners on the pedestrian overpass in protest of Trump&apos;s authoritarian takeover of our country. Join us on the pedestrian overpass near Broadway to stand up for democracy freedom and humanity. We currently gather Tuesdays and Thursdays at rush hour and two weekends per month. Check mobilize.us for times and dates.

### Location: 
Bayside Crossing Hwy 101 pedestrian overpass at Broadway


### Parking:
Easiest parking is on the east side near the baseball field at Bayside Park on Airport Blvd. Walk through the lot towards the hotel. There is a gate in the fence. Walk through the gate and turn right. The overpass will be on your left, just before you reach the Broadway intersection. 
  https://maps.app.goo.gl/UgSn1vGjK73c7jCx6

You can access the overpass on Rollins Rd. on the West side of Hwy101. However, parking is usually very limited. 

 
We create and display large banners on highway overpasses in the Bay Area.  In Burlingame, we use the Bayside pedestrian overpass near Broadway. Associated groups use overpasses on  Hwys 1, 17, 80 and 85. In the last year, together we have reached an estimated seven million drivers .

### Our banners

We string fabric letters together to create our messages. We also make large painted fabric banners.  Some of our recent messages include:

-END ICE TERROR
-TELL SENATE NO $ 4 ICE
-JUSTICE 4 ICE VICTIMS
- FUND HEALTHCARE NOT WARFARE


Join us, and help fight back in solidarity, as if democracy depends upon it. IT DOES!!
We have the banners...we need YOU! Bring friends, music, noisemaker, signs etc... Small signs can not be read from the freeway but will be seen by anyone passing by on the overpass.

Contact us at bannering101@gmail.com if you would like to know more or get involved. Visit visibilitybrigade.com to learn more about other groups like ours all over the country. Join Indivisible San Mateo https://www.indivisiblesanmateo.com or Indivisible Mid Peninsula https://indivisiblemp.org to organize with  your community.

<h3>Mill Valley #NoICENoWar</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Sunday, February 15, 2026 at 12:00 AM UTC - 1:30 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>47 N Knoll Rd<br>Mill Valley, CA 94941</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> May Day Strong</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Trump is waging war and committing murder to enrich his billionaire backers. We are fighting to stop him. **Stand with us and take action this weekend to demand an end to the occupation of Venezuela and our cities.** 

We’re focusing on corporate targets - companies set to benefit most from the occupation of ICE or Venezuela. 

This week, our target is **Hilton Hotels**, housing this administration&apos;s ICE goons.

**We stand united demanding an end to the Venezuelan occupation and the removal of reckless untrained ICE agents from our communities.** And we&apos;re taking our fight to the companies that are backing this administration and benefiting most.

**Together we will hit these companies in their pocketbooks, force the administration to end the occupation of Venezuela and our cities and spread the word to our neighbors that we deserve better.**

Every dollar spent in wars overseas or at home is a dollar we paid for with our taxes - a dollar that could and should go to helping our communities thrive. We can have good jobs, better schools, access to healthcare and get our basic needs met. But not while our government works for billionaires and not for us.

Join us, stand strong and speak up.

*Please note: A core principle behind all our events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events*</p>

<h3>ICE Out of Marin County Housing</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Sunday, February 15, 2026 at 12:00 AM UTC - 1:30 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Kruger Pines Seniors 4 Peace Clubhouse<br>49 N Knoll Rd<br>Mill Valley, CA 94941</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Wednesday, January 7th, an American citizen was killed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Minneapolis, Minnesota. This killing is part of a broader pattern of unchecked violence, impunity, and abuse carried out by federal immigration enforcement agencies against members of our communities. 

A broad coalition of groups across the country is calling for a coordinated Ice Out For Good Weekend of Action on Saturday, January 10th and Sunday, January 11th to demand accountability, honor the life lost, and make visible the human cost of ICE’s actions. 

A core principle behind all ICE Out For Good events is a commitment to nonviolent action and no civil disobedience. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values, and to act lawfully at these events. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events. All events should be held in public spaces or on public property.

By registering, you agree to receive info from Indivisible about the event, receive communications via e-mail or SMS message from Indivisible, and receive any other updates and opportunities to take action or support ICE OUT FOR GOOD partner organizations. You also agree to have any data entered in this registration collected by Indivisible.

<h3>A Whistle and a Cell Phone. The only weapons I own.</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, February 24, 2026 at 7:00 PM UTC - 7:45 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>In solidarity with Unitarian Universalists’, Faith Leaders, Everyone in Minneapolis, the United States, and the World,
The Witticists hosts Drop-In Virtual Peace Events
Ongoing Virtual Events - Join from Anywhere. 
Tuesdays, Jan 27, Feb 10, and Mar 10 - from 11:00 am - 11:45 am

Drop-In Anytime during the scheduled hours,
and stay as long as you can.
Peace Rally Let’s Talk humbly, thoughtfully, about what’s happening in Minneapolis and our local communities. Make good noise. Bring a whistle, or improvise.

“On Friday, January 23, Minnesotans of every race, place, and faith gathered across the state in prayer vigils for a Day of Truth and Freedom.
It was a statewide day of non-violent moral action, reflection: no work, no school, no shopping — only community, conscience, and collective action.

“The clergy call and gathering on the 22nd was intended to amplify and support the demands of 1/23:
1. ICE must leave Minnesota immediately.
2. The officer who killed Renee Good must be held legally accountable.
3. No additional federal funding for ICE in the upcoming Congressional budget and ICE should be investigated for human and Constitutional violations of Americans and our neighbors.
4. We call upon Minnesota and national companies to become 4th Amendment businesses, cease economic relations with ICE, and refuse ICE entry or using their property for staging grounds.
Visit ICE Out Now MN and May Day Strong for more information.”
It was a statewide day of non-violent moral action, reflection.
There was a unified, statewide pause in daily economic activity. Instead, Minnesotans spent time with family, neighbors, and their community to show Minnesota’s moral heart and collective economic power. 

WITTicists “We’re In This Together”
Georgette deBlois, host, is passionate about social issues and pro-education, choice, diversity, and LGBTQ+. In March of 2025, Randy Jones  joined with her to form an online political discussion group called the WITTicists, WITT being an acronym for We’re In This Together. In October 2025, we were invited to be an &quot;Indivisible&quot; Group. We host virtual and attend in-person rallies to break the yoke of disinformation and misinformation, and with peaceful, no-nonsense, loud voices, declare allegiance to the Constitution and the Protection of Our Democracy

This a local Indivisible event

*A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*</p>

<h3>Justice for Renée Good / Alex Pretti - ICE out of Home Depot Protest</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Sunday, February 15, 2026 at 7:00 PM UTC - 9:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Bicentennial Way &amp; Mendocino Avenue<br>Santa Rosa, CA 95403</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Sonoma County</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>On Wednesday, January 7th, an American citizen, Renée Good, was killed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Minneapolis, Minnesota. This killing is part of a broader pattern of unchecked violence, impunity, and abuse carried out by federal immigration enforcement agencies against members of our communities.

On August 14, 2025, Roberto Carlos Montoya died during an I.C.E raid in Monrovia, California. He was struck by a car and killed while being pursued by I.C.E. Almost immediately, DHS released a dishonest press release denying responsibility for Roberto&apos;s death. This is the second documented death during an I.C.E. raid. There have been numerous protests at Home Depot locations across Southern California. Now in solidarity, protests will begin at Home Depot locations in Northern California.

A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.

Rain cancels and no event on holiday weekends.</p>

<h3>Tell Target: ICE OUT NOW - Justice for Renee Good &amp; Alex Pretti</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 14, 2026 at 7:00 PM UTC - 9:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Target - Santa Rosa South (public sidewalks)<br>1980 Santa Rosa Ave<br>Santa Rosa, CA 95404</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Sonoma County</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>ICE OUT OF TARGET
Justice for Renee Good and Alex Pretti

Silence is complicity. It’s time to boycott and protest those corporations that comply with the fascist actions of this regime.
 
**Meet on the public sidewalk, north side of Kawana Springs Road at traffic light at the entrance to the Target store parking lot. This is between Santa Rosa Ave and Petaluma Hill Road.**

Protest on sidewalk, bring signs, whistles, and a friend!

*Why Protest Target?*

ICE Staging Locations in MN - It’s alleged that ICE is using Target parking lots to stage their MN operations

Employees are ICE Victims – Some Target employees are being detained, beaten in at least one case, and sent to detention centers 

Corporate cowardice and silence – Target’s corporate headquarters are located in MN. They have said nothing about the lawless actions being perpetrated by ICE in their hometown. (Note: They signed onto a wholly inadequate letter from a MN Business Leadership organization)

Protest Goals – Target needs to publicly oppose immigration activity on its premises, protect employees, and refuse to cooperate with ICE

<h3>Sanctuary Schools action at Eureka City Schools Board</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Friday, February 13, 2026 at 1:30 AM UTC - 4:30 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Eureka City Schools Office - Francis H. Taplin Board Room<br>2011 J St<br>Eureka, CA 95501</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>This a local Indivisible event!

Eureka is by law a sanctuary city.

But did you know that under current school board policy,
school staff are supposed to stand idly by and merely &quot;document&quot; what happens when ICE enters a campus without consent, **&quot;even if the officer appears to be acting outside the law or in excess of the officer&apos;s stated or documented authorization?&quot;**

We can do better!

Come and urge the Board to make Eureka&apos;s campuses **Sanctuary Schools:**

1. Limit the share of student information with federal immigration authorities.
2. Restrict immigration agents’ access to campus.
3. Prohibit campus security from collaborating with federal immigration authorities for the purposes of enforcement.
4. Provide resources and information for immigrant students and their families.


*A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*</p>

People classified as &quot;migrants&quot; are in the eye of the fascist storm sweeping across the world. As Trump tries to put a tyrannical, authoritarian regime in place, ICE has sent out plainclothed, masked gunmen to grab our neighbors, co-workers, and friends and disappear them into private, for-profit immigration jails. Children are being torn away from their parents - again. Migrants are being deported to random countries, paid by Trump to warehouse them. What is being done to migrants today is rapidly spreading to affect those of us classified as citizens. We must reject Trump&apos;s efforts to divide citizens from migrants. We do that by acting in solidarity and crushing Trump&apos;s ICE machine.</p>

<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Join us in Kapolei Regional Park across from the Kapolei Police Station to protest the Trump regime&apos;s efforts to destroy our democracy and establish a fascist government with him as its dictator.

This is a warm-up protest for the upcoming No Dictators/No Kings Day Protest on March 28, 2026. We are protesting the many illegal and unconstitutional actions the regime has taken, including the murder of two American citizens by ICE, the deaths of others in ICE&apos;s custody, the incarceration and deportation of American citizens and legal residents, and the occupation of American cities by ICE and the National Guard. 

Protest the spineless Republican Members of Congress and the corrupt Supreme Court for enabling this insanity and the destruction of our country to continue. We believe that those responsible for these acts should ultimately face justice.</p>

## Defend Immigrants and Our Communities

IEB is working with Street Level Health Project and the Immigrant Defense Committee in Fruitvale to support Adopt a Day Labor Corner.  

Now is the time to show up for our neighbors by joining IEB&apos;s Adopt a Corner Team at Home Depot in Oakland. We provide you with training and orientation and we ask you to volunteer one 2-hour shift per week.  

ICE has been conducting raids at Home Depot stores across the country. Day laborers are the most vulnerable immigrants, risking their freedom to look for work and feed their families. 

Showing up for Adopt a Day Labor Corner is an important and challenging opportunity to support immigrants who risk ICE abductions, deportation and family separation.  Our presence at Home Depot can make a difference.

        <name>PETITION: Stop Secret Deportations and Stand for Due Process in America</name>

<h3>PETITION: Stop Secret Deportations and Stand for Due Process in America</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, May 17, 2025 at 4:00 AM UTC - 4:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Mississippi Democratic Party</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>They say this is the land of the free—but in today’s America, people are being taken from their homes and communities without warning, without a lawyer, and without even a phone call.

Right now, under this administration, ICE agents are rounding up men, women, and even children—some of them U.S. citizens—without proper identification, without cause, and without any concern for our rights as Americans. 

They’re skipping courts. They’re skipping judges. They’re putting people on planes and shipping them out like they don’t matter.

This isn’t law and order. This is government overreach. And it’s not how things are supposed to work in a country that calls itself free.

We know what it’s like down here in Mississippi. We know what it feels like to be ignored, mistreated, and pushed to the side. Now ICE is doing the same to our neighbors, our church members, our coworkers, and our friends.

Nobody should be dragged off in the night with no hearing, no lawyer, no phone call.

Whether someone’s lived here ten years or ten generations, they deserve a fair shot. That’s just basic justice—and the kind of freedom our country is supposed to stand for.

Sign this petition and tell our elected leaders:

We want ICE held accountable. We want due process respected. And we won’t stand for secret deportations in our communities.

This is our home, and we’re not letting fear take it from us.</p>

        <name>ICE OUT OF ATX - Demand APD stop collaborating with ICE &amp; DHS</name>
        <description><![CDATA[
<h3>ICE OUT OF ATX - Demand APD stop collaborating with ICE &amp; DHS</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Wednesday, January 14, 2026 at 6:00 AM UTC - 6:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Hands Off Central TX - Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>We, undersigned, **call on the City of Austin to protect Austin residents from the violence of ICE and DHS** by immediately prohibiting the Austin Police Department from supporting any attempt by ICE or DPS to question, detain, and deport Austin residents and visitors.

We condemn the Austin Police Department&apos;s continued cooperation with federal law enforcement agencies who verifiably and repeatedly violate people’s constitutional rights, operate outside of their jurisdiction, and ignore due process.

We call on Austin City Council, Mayor Kirk Watson, and City Manager T.C. Broadnax to **immediately pass a city ordinance that prevents any APD employee from helping immigration agents** serving administrative warrants to Austin residents, including but not limited to:

Running a warrant check for ICE/DHS administrative warrants

- Serving ICE/DHS administrative warrants

- Detaining people on behalf of ICE/DHS

- Handing people over to ICE/DHS who are in APD custody

- Alerting these ICE/DHS to the location of Austin residents and visitors

We call on Austin Police Chief Lisa Davis to immediately **retrain the entire APD staff** to prevent city employees from knowingly or unknowingly notifying ICE of the residency address or current location of Austinites with ICE/DPS administrative warrants.

Austin Police Department’s assistance to ICE and DPS is quickly eroding the remaining trust Austinites have in our local government and local law enforcement. 

ICE and Border Patrol have **consistently escalated harm against civilians across the United States.** Here in Austin, they are racially profiling our communities, stopping Austin drivers without cause, and detaining and deporting our neighbors without due process.

Last week, the Austin Police Department responded to a 911 call. The department ran a warrant check for the women who had called them, which turned up an administrative immigration warrant. As a result, an **Austin mother and her child, who is a U.S. citizen, were taken into custody by federal immigration officials,** not allowed to share the details of their detainment with their family or local advocacy organizations, and deported even though the child is an American citizen.

This is only one of many stories from APD collaboration with federal immigration authorities.

If the City of Austin wants to claim that **our police department exists to serve and protect** our residents, the city should provide full transparency around the actions and policies of city employees, if city employees are even tangentially involved, when our neighbors go missing from their homes and workplaces.

APD in any way facilitating the detainment of Austin residents by any federal immigration department significantly impacts safety in our community by making it **less likely that immigrants, undocumented people, people of color, and anyone associated with the anti-ICE movement will report crimes** or cooperate with local law enforcement.

Immigration agents are increasing their violence and harassment of American residents, including undocumented immigrants, immigrants on valid visas, protestors, journalists, first responders, doctors, lawyers, bystanders, and legal observers. They have released chemical weapons into vehicles and on school property. They flagrantly and repeatedly violate their own use of force guidelines, act outside of their jurisdiction, and ignore due process altogether.

These agents and their lawlessness pose a significant bodily threat to the safety of every Austinite, and **we demand that the City of Austin act with expediency to prevent further detainment and deportations due to the actions of city employees.**

We demand city guarantees that the department is refusing to search for and serve ICE and DHS warrants, and new APD policies that materially protect Austin residents and visitors from ICE and DHS violence.</p>

<h3>Take Action Now To Save Lives From ICE</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, January 24, 2026 at 5:00 AM UTC - 5:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> MoveOn</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Alex Jeffrey Pretti, Renee Nicole Good, Keith Porter, and many, many others have now been executed by President Trump’s ICE. The administration is murdering people in the streets for peacefully protesting to protect their neighbors and children. It’s heartbreaking and horrifying. Yet in the face of ICE’s brutality, Minnesotans aren’t giving up, they’re showing up. 

In freezing temperatures, tens of thousands of Minnesotans are taking the streets, delivering groceries to immigrant families, and joining together in community. Minnesota is leading the way, and MoveOn is coming together to stand with them.

Sign the pledge to take action against ICE, and be in solidarity with Minnesotans, and we&apos;ll be in touch with next steps.</p>

<h3>Host Your Own Powered by Love Gathering: Letter Writing for Immigrants in Detention 💌</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Wednesday, February 4, 2026 at 5:00 AM UTC - 5:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> United We Dream Network</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Over the past month, we&apos;ve watched ICE spread fear throughout our communities, detaining children like five-year-old Liam Conejo Ramos on his way home from preschool. We&apos;ve also seen the incredible resistance of children and parents detained in Dilley, Texas, fighting back from inside a family detention center that should never exist. We refuse to keep watching families suffer. ** Join us to turn this anger and grief into tangible love and solidarity for our immigrant neighbors in detention.** 

❤️‍🔥 Love and dignity for detained immigrants comes from us, the people. It starts with empathy, with care, and with something as simple as a letter. A letter that tells someone in detention: we see you, we hear you, and we&apos;re with you. People enduring abuse and inhumane conditions need to hear voices rooting for their freedom and dignity.

💌 **That&apos;s why United We Dream is calling on you to host a Letter Writing Gathering with your friends and/or family**. Turn your Galentine&apos;s dinner, movie night, or weekly hangout into an opportunity to offer hope and human connection to people who need it most.

Please fill out this interest form to commit to inviting your circle to write letters to immigrants in detention. Join us to be a part of the movement that will build a future without cages and family separation, a future where we will have everything we need to flourish.

🌟 **When you sign up, you’ll receive a link to our toolkit with information on next steps for hosting a letter writing gathering and invitation to get further support if you have any questions!** 🌟</p>

These actions are designed to make a clear public statement: standing with our neighbors means refusing to stay silent while families are torn apart.

You don’t need to be an expert organizer or have everything figured out. We’ll provide a toolkit, training, and staff support to help you plan an action that fits your community.

💘 _Love means taking a stand._

<h3>I&apos;m Ready to Resist.  My Non-Cooperation Actions</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Thursday, February 5, 2026 at 8:00 AM UTC - 7:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Outer East Portland Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>### Ready to Resist?
**Remember a time when you said “No” to authority.** (maybe many years ago; maybe yesterday)
What happened? __     How did it feel in your body? __      Did that action change your relationship to that person/institution? __  What did you learn about yourself? __

**There are so many good examples from World War II. Occupied by the Nazis, the Danes resisted fascism, and so can we.**
Many Danes tried keeping their head down, staying quiet at first. That didn’t work. (It never does)  These commandments,  authored by a 17yr old resistance member, with simple, everyday moral commandments for Danes caught fire. It was copied by hand, whispered neighbor to neighbor, wheat pasted on walls. Five years of collective non-cooperation through the 1945 collapse of the Nazis, delivered a renewed Denmark with strong sense of community and commitment to social justice.
### Let’s build our own Oregon Non-Cooperation State of Mind
Here’s some **ideas we&apos;ve heard so far** from our organizers and activists
Which of these would you endorse?  
**Please share your ideas and suggestions** – this is grassroots work in progress.    We’ll continue to post and share

- Protect those targeted by the regime – call the PIRC hotline, act as an observer, accompany and/or deliver for threatened people 
- Publicly mock the regime, make fun of them
- Everyday I leave the house, I wear a protest button, sparking conversation and keeping the issue top-of-mind.
- Do not shop with corporate enablers and collaborators – Home Depot, Target, Amazon, Hilton, ________
- Support local small business, and build buy-nothing local mutual aid networks 
- Join walkouts, economic shut-downs, no work, no school, no shopping days.
- Know our neighbors – make eye contact, have conversation, organize together 
- Put a Mexican flag on your car – to distract, waste ICE time.
- Use cash – withhold your data, slow consolidation of wealth
- Reject everyday surveillance – support companies that value and invest in privacy
- Make connections; build my activist network
- Know My Rights
- Build My Strike Fund

<h3>South Asians Demand an Immediate End to Lawless ICE Violence</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Thursday, February 12, 2026 at 6:00 AM UTC - 4:59 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> SAAVE Texas</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>This is no longer political. It is a constitutional and moral crisis.
SAMPLE SCRIPT 

Hi, my name is [NAME], and I’m a South Asian constituent from [CITY, ZIP].

I’m calling because I am deeply concerned about the direction of this country. This is no longer politics — it is a moral, ethical, and constitutional crisis.

We have now witnessed two Americans, Renee Good and Alex Pretti, shot and killed by federal immigration agents, while countless others are dying in detention without ever having their day in court.

Armed, often unidentified agents are approaching South Asian families without warrants, without transparency, and without accountability. The line between constitutional law and unchecked force is being erased.

We demand that you act immediately to stop ICE’s lawless violence, defend constitutional protections, and refuse to fund abuse.

Texas is home to one of the largest South Asian populations in the country, and our communities are watching closely.

I demand that Senator Cornyn oppose any funding that expands ICE and push for immediate accountability and strict constitutional limits on enforcement.

OTHER DETAILS TO SHARE 
Congress must stop ICE now and defend the Constitution
South Asian communities are in deep fear and alarm as armed, often unidentified agents approach families without warrants, without transparency, and without accountability. The line between lawful enforcement and unchecked violence is being erased, and constitutional protections are being dangerously blurred.

We have now witnessed two Americans shot and killed by federal immigration agents, while countless others have died in detention without ever having their day in court. This breakdown of due process and rule of law threatens every community.

Texas is home to one of the largest South Asian populations in the country, and our families are watching closely.

We demand immediate action to stop ICE’s lawless violence, defend constitutional rights, and refuse to fund abuse.

Join us in calling Senators Cruz and Cornyn to demand accountability, constitutional protections, and an end to this crisis.</p>

        <name>To Immigrants With Love | Valentine&apos;s Week of Action</name>
        <description><![CDATA[
<h3>To Immigrants With Love | Valentine&apos;s Week of Action</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Thursday, February 12, 2026 at 2:00 PM UTC - 2:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Disappeared in America</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>**Sign up to show your participation and receive a simple action you can take each day.** 

This Valentine’s Day week, people across the country are coming together to show love and solidarity with immigrant communities—and to reject the violent, intrusive, and unlawful tactics being carried out by the Trump Department of Homeland Security (DHS), including Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP). 

This is a week of nonviolent action, collective care, and public accountability. Below are 4 simple ways to take part. Choose one or take on several. Every action matters.

**1) Share Love &amp; Solidarity on Social Media**
Use your voice to help flood social media with messages of love, dignity, and solidarity for immigrants and their families.

What to do:

- Post a message of love and solidarity for immigrant communities
Share why you believe immigrants deserve safety, dignity, and due process
- Lift up stories from your own community if you feel comfortable

**Please use this To Immigrants With Love social media toolkit from FWD.us with sample language, graphics, and video templates. Social Toolkit:** https://tinyurl.com/5kz75rbf

Why it matters: Public narrative shapes public action. When we show up together online, we counter fear with humanity.

**2) Call on Congress: Demand Accountability from ICE and CBP** 
Congress has the power—and the responsibility—to oversee DHS and stop abuses.

What to do:

- Call or email your U.S. Senators and Representative
- Demand real accountability, transparency, and consequences for ICE and CBP abuses
- Oppose any new funding for ICE or CBP without enforceable oversight and accountability

Call the Capitol switchboard and ask to be connected with your members of Congress: (202) 224-3121

You can also use these quick and simple email tools to send your members of Congress a message right now! 

- Public Citizen tool: https://www.citizen.org/email-congress-ice-funding

- Stand Up America tool: https://act.standupamerica.com/letters/letter-no-ice-funding/

**3) Plug into Ongoing Immigrant Rights Actions**
Many national organizations are organizing actions, vigils, and rapid-response efforts to support immigrant communities on an ongoing basis. 

What to do:

- Participate in ongoing programs and activities being led to support immigrant rights and due process
- Share their calls to action with your networks
- Amplify immigrant voices and leadership

Here are a few great groups doing important ongoing work!  

National Daylaborer Organizing Network (NDLON) 
- Adopt a Corner https://ndlon.org/adopt-a-day-labor-corner/

Detention Watch Network
- Communities Not Cages https://www.detentionwatchnetwork.org/take-action/communitiesnotcages 

United We Dream
- Deportation Defense https://unitedwedream.org/our-work/deportation-defense/ 

The Workers Circle 
- Freedom Vigils http://freedomvigils.org

National Coalition to End Family and Child Detention
- Paper Dolls to Free Families: https://tinyurl.com/4w255wpu
- Free Families Vigils: https://freefamilies.net/ 

**4) Commit to Showing Up for Immigrants in Your Community**
Solidarity doesn’t stop at policy—it lives in our neighborhoods.

What this can look like:

- Support an immigrant-owned business by donating or buying from them (in MN, local immigrant owned business are struggling to survive, and many might not reopen after the occupation) 

- Connect through schools and parents associations to provide support to immigrant families   

- If you are a religious person, ask your pastor to preach from the pulpit and/or connect through a congregation to provide support to families in need

- Connect with local mutual aid networks to provide rides, translation, and other kinds of support

- Hire a day laborer! Providing a day of work with fair pay is an act of solidarity!

- Bake cookies or share a meal with an immigrant family nearby

- Simply check in on neighbors who may be feeling afraid or targeted

- Make it personal: Choose one concrete act of care you can do this weekend—and commit to it.

**Our Shared Commitment**

This weekend is about more than protest. It’s about choosing love over fear, community over cruelty, and accountability over abuse of power.
No matter how you participate, thank you for showing up with compassion, courage, and solidarity.</p>

<h3>Anti-Valentine Party - Congressional Review of Bill Huizenga</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Thursday, February 12, 2026 at 9:00 PM UTC - 10:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> For Our Future Michigan</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Join us to hold Rep. Bill Huizenga accountable for turning his back on working families in West Michigan. We’ll share stories from constituents who’ve tried to reach his office about his votes to cut healthcare,  threaten Social Security and Medicare, and recklessly fund ICE — only to be ignored or dismissed.

Together, we’ll turn these stories into public accountability by posting Google reviews that show how Huizenga’s record has raised costs, risked coverage, and hurt working families.

Huizenga has voted to strip healthcare from 15 million Americans, double premiums for 24 million more, and slash Medicaid and SNAP by over a trillion dollars—all to benefit billionaires and special interests. Let’s stand together for affordable healthcare, government accountability, and policies that work for the working people of Michigan.</p>

<h3>Join our Phone Bank: Help frontline communities be heard on extreme weather</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Thursday, February 12, 2026 at 10:30 PM UTC - 11:30 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Climate Action Campaign</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Communities in Tampa, FL and Northern Michigan are on the frontlines of extreme weather.

In Florida, families are still recovering from massive climate disasters like Hurricanes Helene and Milton. In Northern Michigan, dangerous ice storms left more than 145,000 homes and businesses without power in sub-freezing temperatures.

In the meantime, we’re seeing the Trump Administration rolling back guardrails on pollution standards and giving big polluters a free pass. 

That’s why, Climate Action Campaign and our partners are organizing  People’s Hearings in both Florida and Michigan to make sure the voices of those directly impacted by extreme weather are heard loud and clear, and to demand stronger climate action from our elected leaders.

We need volunteers to help us reach out to folks in these communities.

Join our phone bank and help recruit community members who’ve lived through these disasters and ensure their stories are heard! We’ll train you on making calls and help you every step of the way!</p>

<h3>GOTV for Georgia CD14 Special Election and Wisconsin Supreme Court Race</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Thursday, February 12, 2026 at 11:00 PM UTC - 1:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Engage Blue</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>We&apos;ll be calling/texting South Asian voters in Georgia&apos;s Congressional District 14 to get out the vote for the special election that will be held on March 10th, 2026. This is the house seat that was recently vacated by Marjorie Taylor Greene. As we have seen massive overperformances by Democratic candidate in special elections, there is a possibility that the Democrat can win in this race. However, we are also interested in getting people who live in Georgia in the habit of voting to ensure that Jon Ossoff wins his Senate race this November. 

Additionally, we will also be getting out the vote for the Wisconsin Supreme Court race on April 7th. Here, liberal judge, Chris Taylor, will be facing off against Maria Lazer, a conservative judge. This election for this open race could expand the liberal majority on the Wisconsin state Supreme Court.

Thirdly, we will be calling voters living in states represented by moderate Republicans to encourage them to contact their Senators in support of the changes to ICE&apos;s behaviors requested by Democrats in order to fund the Department of Homeland Security. These changes include forcing ICE to seek warrants before detaining people and requiring that ICE officers be unmasked.</p>

<h3>Powered By Love, Not Cages Community Call</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Friday, February 13, 2026 at 12:00 AM UTC - 1:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> United We Dream Network</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Join us for **Powered By Love, Not Cages** Community Call, where we&apos;ll write letters to our immigrant community in detention.   

Together, we&apos;ll respond to the escalating ICE presence in our communities by extending care, love, and dignity to our immigrant neighbors in detention. In the face of fear and uncertainty, we’re choosing community, solidarity, and collective power.

On the call we’ll:

- 🫂 Come together to discuss the moment, how we’re feeling, and what we can do about it. 
- 💌 Write letters of encouragement to offer hope and human connection to people in detention and how you can get your letters to those who are detained.
- 🫱🏽‍🫲🏾 Share a toolkit that guides you on how you can host similar letter writing gatherings with your friends, loved ones, and classmates. 

Your participation matters. The emotions we&apos;re feeling - rage, helplessness, grief - are all real and justified, but we can channel them into care that reaches people when they need it most. In detention centers, where conditions are deliberately unbearable, a letter reminding someone of their humanity and our solidarity can sustain them in their fight for freedom.

**Be in community, RSVP today!**</p>

<h3>Governing With Courage: State Leaders Standing Up to ICE</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Friday, February 13, 2026 at 1:00 AM UTC - 2:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> States Win</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>**Join us on Thursday, February 12th for Governing With Courage: State Leaders Standing Up to ICE** 

State leaders across the country are using every lever they have to slow, block, and respond to ICE abuses. Join **States Win** (formerly Sister District) and **New American Leaders Action Fund** for a timely conversation with state legislators from **Minnesota, Michigan, Arizona,** and **Virginia.** These courageous state lawmakers are using their voices and authority to push back against federal overreach and protect their communities, turning lived experience into action and resistance into real policy change.

We’ll also highlight opportunities to volunteer and other ways to support the powerful work these legislators are doing. 

We’ll be joined by:

- MN Senator **Zaynab Mohamed**

- MN Senator **Ann Johnson Stewart**

- VA Delegate **Elizabeth Guzman**

- AZ Representative **Lorena Austin**

- MI Representative **Mai Xiong**

At States Win, we act every day to build Democratic power in state legislatures and to create real, lasting improvements in people’s lives. Our electoral work is a long-term investment in change, and we’ll highlight opportunities to volunteer for strategic state legislative candidates right now. 

New American Leaders Action Fund is the only national organization solely focused on elevating the political power of first- and second-generation immigrants and refugees. We endorse and support trailblazing New American candidates, conduct original research to shape narratives, and engage voters to build a more inclusive democracy.

Across the country, New American leaders are helping drive the fight in state legislatures — proving that when we elect the right leaders, state power can be a force for protection, dignity, and hope.</p>

JAN: Here Comes the Sun
By Bill McKibben 
Available on Amazon Paperback and Audible audio book 

The book explores the rapid, cheap growth of solar and wind power and how it offers humanity a genuine, hopeful chance to overcome the climate crisis and build a better civilization, despite fossil fuel industry opposition.

FEB:  A Future We Can Love 
By Susan Bauer-Wu 
Available on Amazon paperback + free audio book with Audible membership

Inspired by a conversation between the Dalai Lama and Greta Thunberg spoke for the first time in January 2021, millions of people around the world took notice. This book captures the lessons that came from that interaction. 


MAR: The Fragile Earth
By David Remnick, Henry Finder 
Available at local library, Hoopla and Amazon Paperback or Audible audio book

A collection of essays that tell the story of climate change—its past, present, and future—taking readers from Greenland to the Great Plains, and into both laboratories and rain forests.

APR: The Genius of Earth Day
By Adam Rome
Available at local library, Hoopla, Amazon + free audiobook with Audible membership.

The story of the first Earth Day is inspiring: it had a power, a freshness, and a seriousness of purpose that are difficult to imagine today. Earth Day 1970 created an entire green generation. 

MAY:  Amplify
By Adam Met 
Available on Amazon in paperback or Audible audio book

A musician and member of the multiplatinum band AJR, Adam Met is also a climate advocate and educator, who shows how to apply fan-building strategies to social movements in exciting, inventive ways. Amplify is a playbook for developing passionate supporters utilizing the art and science of engagement, collaboration, and authentic connection, with tactics that will inspire people to carry a climate message to the world and spur others to act.

JUN: Unsettled 
by Steven Koonin 
Available at the local library, on Hoopla and Amazon Paperback or Audible audio book

Koonin was the top science advisor to the Obama administration.  When it comes to climate change, the media, politicians, and other prominent voices have declared that “the science is settled.” In reality, the climate is changing, but the why and how aren’t as clear as you’ve probably been led to believe. Koonin takes listeners behind the headlines, dispels popular myths, and unveils little-known truths. 

JUL: Documentary:  Ice on Fire
Free on Youtube (1:37)
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP2IE8Upehc) 
Narrated by Leonardo DiCaprio

&quot;Ice on Fire&quot; explores the many ways we reduce carbon inputs to the atmosphere and, more importantly, how to &quot;draw&quot; carbon down, bringing CO2 out of the atmosphere and thus paving the way for global temperatures to go down. Through visiting visionaries and scientists young and old, the film explores the deep hope that we can turn away from the brink.  

AUG: Running Out 
By Lucas Bessire
Available at the local library, on Hoopla and Amazon Paperback

The imminent depletion of the Ogallala and other aquifers around the world is a defining planetary crisis of our times. Running Out explores aquifer depletion and the deeper layers through which it gains meaning and force. Anthropologist Lucas Bessire journeyed back to Western Kansas, where five generations of his family lived as irrigation farmers and ranchers, to try to make sense of this vital resource and its loss.

SEPT: Half Earth 
By Edward O. Wilson 
Available at the local library, on Hoopla and Amazon Paperback + Audiobook

In order to stave off the mass extinction of species, including our own, we must move swiftly to preserve the biodiversity of our planet. In this &quot;visionary blueprint for saving the planet&quot; (Stephen Greenblatt), Half-Earth argues that the situation facing us is too large to be solved piecemeal and proposes a solution commensurate with the magnitude of the problem: dedicate fully half the surface of the Earth to nature. 

OCT: The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind (watch the movie or read the book)
Movie: Find it on Youtube or Netflix 
Book: Available at the local library, on Hoopla and Amazon Paperback + Audiobook

Born to a family of farmers, Malawian agricultural engineer William Kamkwamba made headlines in 2001 when he built a functioning windmill out of old bicycle parts and scraps. (At the time, he was just 14 years old.) The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind, based on Kamkwamba’s memoir of the same name, tells the amazing true story of how he built a wind turbine and saved his small farming village from famine.

NOV: The Talking Earth (young adult)
by Jean George 
Available at the local library, on Hoopla and Amazon Paperback + Audiobook

Billie is a member of the Seminole Tribe, in a quest to identify facts over legend, she goes out into the Everglades alone, to stay until she can believe. In the wilderness, she discovers that she must listen to the land and animals in order to survive. With an otter, a panther cub, and a turtle as companions and guides, she begins to understand that the world of her people can give her the answers she seeks.

        <name>Urge Your City Council to SHUT DOWN Flock</name>
        <description><![CDATA[
<h3>Urge Your City Council to SHUT DOWN Flock</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 14, 2026 at 5:30 PM UTC - 5:30 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Southend Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>THIS EVENT IS NOW AND ONGOING (ignore posted date/time)

With the first city council meetings of 2026 beginning, right now is a critical opportunity to urge your council to protect their constituents from Trump&apos;s ICE goons. 

ALPR (Automated License Plate Reader) cameras - i.e. Flock and Axon - have been widely reported by local and national media as being used - often secretly - by ICE to collect data meant only for local police departments. A UW study unveiled that ICE accessed Flock data​​ in at least 18 WA cities: jsis.washington.edu/humanrights/2025/10/21/leaving-the-door-wide-open

It&apos;s now clear these cameras give ICE a powerful surveillance tool to kidnap our neighbors, making all of us LESS safe.

Email your city council with a simple ask: &quot;Shut down ALPR cameras.&quot;

        <name>Schools: Drop ICE Mass Call</name>
        <description><![CDATA[
<h3>Schools: Drop ICE Mass Call</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Monday, February 16, 2026 at 12:00 AM UTC - 1:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Sunrise Movement</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>We will cut off ICE’s corporate enablers — starting on our campuses.

ICE isn’t invincible. Donald Trump’s deportation machine depends on private corporations for technology to track, places to sleep, cars to drive, planes to fly, and parking lots to stage.

Colleges, schools, and universities have real leverage over the companies providing these services to ICE through purchasing, partnerships, and public legitimacy. The fastest way to shrink ICE’s capacity is to cut off its corporate support: push our schools to stop funding and normalizing ICE collaborators.

On this call, you’ll hear how organizers in Minneapolis and beyond moved from defense to offense—picking a few winnable targets and escalating sustained, nonviolent pressure that hits brands and bottom lines. 

You’ll leave with concrete tools to map your university’s ties, link up with others on your campus, and run an escalating campaign that forces decision-makers to drop ICE’s billionaire partners.

The stakes are high, it&apos;s time to rise up.

We refuse to cooperate with billionaires, the two-party system, and authoritarianism.

Join us to train up on the skills you need to kick ICE off your campus and out of your community &amp; prepare to rise up with students and workers across the country on May Day to bring the authoritarian regime and the billionaires propping it up to their knees.

<h3>Statewide Organizing Working Group</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Monday, February 16, 2026 at 11:00 PM UTC - 12:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> New York Working Families Party</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>From Onondaga County to New York City, the Working Families Party secured historic electoral wins this November -- and now the work has only just begun. The Trump Administration has slashed funding for critical services like SNAP and Medicaid, dumped millions of tax payer dollars into ICE, and is gearing up to cut more and more from our budget. New York State has the power and responsibility to STEP UP during the 2026 state budget and make the ultra wealthy pay their fare share so that we can fund the programs and services that allow NYers to thrive. Universal childcare, affordable housing, a true living wage, affordable and accessible healthcare are all possible and on the horizon for NYS. 

But we need YOU 🫵 to win.

Join us on Mondays at 6pm from January through April to build statewide power and directly contribute to NY WFP&apos;s strategy to advance policies that address the deep rooted economic inequalities in our state. 

Come ready to: lead virtual/in-person field events, sharpen your strategic decision making skills, deepen our collective political education, and meet likeminded volunteers across NYS.

NO PRIOR EXPERIENCE NECESSARY!</p>

<h3>Let&apos;s Talk - Legislative Phone Bank</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, February 17, 2026 at 12:00 AM UTC - 2:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> TIRRC Votes</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>## Join us each week as we call voters across Tennessee to mobilize them to contact their legislators and urge them to stand against bills attacking our communities, our neighbors, and our futures.

*This is a virtual opportunity and training will be provided each shift.*

This Legislative Session, we&apos;re more determined than ever to fight for the rights and freedoms of everyone across Tennessee, whether you were born in Memphis or Mexico, Mountain City or Mozambique. We believe that if you live and are making a life here, Tennessee is your home and you deserve to feel safe and have the resources you need to build a good life for yourself and your family. 

Yet the Republican supermajority is planning to scale up attacks on immigrant neighbors instead of enacting policies Tennesseans actually want and have been asking for for years, such as fully funded schools, no tax on groceries, and affordable healthcare. We deserve a Tennessee where working families come first, where our tax dollars go to our communities instead of the escalation of force from ICE agents against our neighbors.</p>

<h3>ICE Out For Good Funding Fight Weekly Phonebank</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, February 17, 2026 at 6:00 PM UTC - 8:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Our communities are being terrorized by masked federal agents. They’re teargassing babies, kidnapping our neighbors, shooting clergy in the face with chemical projectiles, and killing innocent people.

We have an opportunity to rein in ICE and Border Patrol at the federal level. Congress is currently negotiating funding for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which includes ICE and Border Patrol. We are demanding our Members of Congress write a bill that stops the violence in our communities and holds ICE and Border Patrol agents accountable. This is our opportunity to put significant restrictions on these agencies and ensure they don’t get a single penny more to enable their brutality.

Join us every Tuesday at 1 p.m. EST while DHS funding is being negotiated to engage voters in key states and encourage them to call their Members of Congress and tell them to hold the line and demand that ICE’s terror tactics be stopped for good.

(This event is presented by Indivisible Project.)

**PLEASE NOTE: If negotiations change and the need for weekly phone banks no longer exists, this event will be cancelled.**</p>

<h3>Talk to our Neighbors about ICE: Phone Bank with SURJ!</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, February 17, 2026 at 11:00 PM UTC - 2:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Showing Up for Racial Justice</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>#### Right now is the time to intervene.  To step up.  To move our people.

As the Trump Administration continues to deploy violent ICE agents to our nation&apos;s cities, we remain clear and centered on the following truths:

1. White working class Americans have so much to gain by standing in solidarity with our immigrant neighbors.
2. Trump’s aggressive and violent deployment of ICE is causing many white working class communities to re-evaluate their views and beliefs on immigration.
3. Listening-forward conversations that support people to reflect on their values, feelings and experiences can shift their attitudes, perspective and behavior.

That&apos;s why we&apos;re channeling these truths into a powerful action that you can take with us.

**Join SURJ to talk to key white working class voters about their feelings on Trump’s immigration policies and deployment of ICE in the key congressional districts  that will determine control of the House in the 2026 elections.**

Together, we can move the needle and build power.  No prior experience needed – we’ll provide all the resources,  training and support you need to phone bank with us to have these critical conversations at a critical juncture for shaping public opinion and our society’s commonsense beliefs around immigration policy</p>

<h3>Community Club Reads: Woodworking</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Wednesday, February 18, 2026 at 1:00 AM UTC - 2:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Vote Save America PAC</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>The VSA Community Reads book club is back, and this time we’re reading **Woodworking by Emily St. James**! Join some of the kindest, most fun political and book nerds out there to talk about this incredible novel, and how stories like this can help us better understand ourselves, our world, and our politics. Together we’ll also build community ahead of the massively important midterm elections this November. 

**Reading Guide:**
For our book club discussions on Woodworking by Emily St. James, here’s your reading guide:

- Feb 17 (8ET/5PT): Read &quot;September&quot; pgs. 1-69

- Mar 03 (8ET/5PT): Read &quot;October&quot; pgs. 70-250

- Mar 17 (8ET/5PT): Read &quot;November&quot; and &quot;December&quot; pgs. 251-347


**How it works:**
Whether you’ve been to book club before or this is your first time, here’s a quick refresher on how it works. For each one-hour meeting we’ll all read the same section of the book (listed above). Then, on the day of the meeting, you’ll hop on zoom. Together as a big group we’ll do some quick housekeeping and an icebreaker in the chat before we head off into breakout rooms to discuss the book. There, you get to hang out with your fellow VSA-friends for a fun discussion facilitated by a couple of your friendly neighborhood VSA community mods. Finally, we’ll come back together for the last few minutes to recap our discussion before we close. 

To get a copy of the book, head to [bookshop.org](https://bookshop.org/p/books/woodworking-emily-st-james/520f0326fb73f621?ean=9781638931478&amp;next=t&amp;&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=dsa_nonbrand&amp;utm_content={adgroupname}&amp;utm_term=aud-1721779758455:dsa-19959388920&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=12440232635&amp;gbraid=0AAAAACfld42zMPPia9T3wyqSaNYDEzADg&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAkPzLBhD4ARIsAGfah8hiIc1S3JqGJD74vDM8hMww-_Oc2K4ylps94Lc4r4VAybUcAzkqGMIaAtYCEALw_wcB), your favorite local independent bookstore or library, or wherever books are sold! 

**About Woodworking by Emily St. James:**
Woodworking is an unforgettable and heartwarming book-club debut following a trans high school teacher from a small town in South Dakota who befriends the only other trans woman she knows: one of her students. Heartwarming, hopeful, and at once wrenching, this is a celebration of intergenerational stories, unlikely friendships, courage, and hope. It doesn’t shy away from the ugliness and hate in the world, but neither does it leave us there - a hopeful tonic in these deeply challenging times.</p>

<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Abel Chavez for Congress</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>We&apos;re calling voters to let them know about the importance of CA-48 to changing Congress and we&apos;re letting them know about Abel&apos;s bold economic agenda to bring immediate change to every American.  All you need is a phone, we&apos;ll provide training.

Abel will fight for:

Medicare for All, because healthcare is a human right - not a profit center; not “more affordable healthcare,” not “more accessible healthcare,” not “eventually,” not “common sense reform.” Universal healthcare for every person in America, unapologetically.

Ending corporate &amp; foreign lobbying influence, so billionaires and special interests can’t purchase policy or politician’s votes

Banning Wall Street landlords in housing, because homes are for families - not hedge funds

Strengthening public education, so every child has the opportunity for a quality education that will land them a career with zero debt.

Defund ICE.</p>

<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> State Voices Florida</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p># ¡TODOS TENEMOS DERECHOS!

## Seas ciudadano o no, la ley te protege.

Únete a nosotros el **18 de Septiembre** a las **6PM EST** en una capacitación gratuita para:

- Conocer tus derechos frente a oficiales de inmigración (en casa, en la calle o en un vehículo).
- Aprender cómo protegerte y preparar a tu familia.
- Informarte sobre las nuevas leyes en Florida que afectan a nuestra comunidad.

 En Florida, todos los condados firmaron _acuerdos 287(g)_ con ICE, lo que significa que la policía local puede actuar como agentes de inmigración incluso en paradas de tráfico. Además, nuevas leyes aumentan las penas contra inmigrantes y limitan el acceso a la educación para estudiantes indocumentados.

Pero no estamos solos. Al informarnos y compartir este conocimiento, podemos cuidarnos entre todos.

En este taller recibirás una Guía de Conozca Sus Derechos (KYR) clara y práctica para protegerte y apoyar a tu comunidad.</p>

<h3>ICE OUT! Text Bank &amp; Listening Party 📲✊🏽🪩</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Friday, February 20, 2026 at 12:00 AM UTC - 1:30 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> United We Dream Action</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>From the streets of LA and Minneapolis to the Grammy stage, the message is clear: **ICE has no place in our communities**.

This year, we have witnessed the terror that federal agents are bringing into our community. We&apos;re outraged by the detention of children like five-year old Liam Conejo Ramos and the hundreds more held in horrific conditions - all paid for by OUR tax dollars.

Workers, neighbors, students, immigrants, and allies are all standing together to demand accountability and policies that strengthen our communities. We&apos;re answering hate with love and we&apos;re keeping each other safe.

🔥🧊The Melt ICE Act, introduced by Congresswoman Delia Ramirez, offers a real solution for this moment. This bill prevents DHS from entering new detention contracts and ends all existing immigration detention contracts,  demanding that money is invested back into our communities, where it belongs. 

📲✊ We’re inviting you to **join The Squad on our “ICE OUT Text bank &amp; Listening Party” on Wednesday, February 19th.** Together, we’ll text thousands of UWDA supporters nationwide to urge their representatives to support the MELT ICE Act!

We&apos;ll keep the energy high with a playlist from artists who have declared ICE OUT -  Bad Bunny, Olivia Dean, and more! - Join us for action and good vibes! 🕺

P.S. Never text banked before with the Squad? No problem! We’ll be providing training during the session. All you need is a laptop or tablet!</p>

<h3>National Call: Defending the 14th &amp; Abolishing ICE!</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Friday, February 20, 2026 at 12:00 AM UTC - 1:30 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Popular Democracy</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>#### Join our National Fight Back Call. **We&apos;re organizing to defend the 14th Amendment by abolishing ICE!**

It’s Black History Month, and we are grounding ourselves in truth: America only became a democracy because Black people and our allies defeated chattel slavery. Out of that victory, we won the 14th Amendment which promises citizenship by birth and guarantees that the law must protect us all equally.   

But today, the Trump regime is using ICE to attack the due process our ancestors fought for and to strip away our fundamental freedoms. **We’ve seen this before, and we know that we only keep the rights we are willing to defend.**


**On the call, we will learn:**

* From organizers in Minnesota about the frontline struggle against ICE
* Why we must Abolish ICE to save our 14th Amendment rights
* And how to become a Defender of the 14th!

See you soon!</p>

<h3>Squad Up and Distribute Know Your Rights Door Hangers! LLAMADA DE ACCIÓN: ¡Conozca sus derechos!</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 21, 2026 at 6:00 PM UTC - 7:30 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> We Are California</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>**********Este mensaje está en español a continuación**********


*When signing up, please include your phone number so we can reach out to you about the training!*

Last year, ICE agents came for our neighbors, families, and friends, armed like they were at war. They brought terror into our schools, neighborhoods, and workplaces -- and we responded the way Angelenos and Californians always do: by standing up for each other. Hundreds of community members passed out thousands of Know Your Rights door hangers in your neighborhoods and at local businesses!

Now, after witnessing the intense escalation of violence by ICE agents at the start of 2026, it is more urgent than ever to prepare ourselves with knowledge, care, and a collective plan of how we will show up for our community.  

We Are California Squads need YOUR help to bring critical Know Your Rights information to homes across Los Angeles by dropping off door hangers to our neighbors and community members. Join this training to learn more about your rights, your risks, and how to share the knowledge in your neighborhood!

Join us to Squad Up and Throw Down for our community!

**********Este mensaje está en español a continuación**********

*Al inscribirse, por favor incluya su número de teléfono para que podamos contactarle sobre el entrenamiento.*

El año pasado, agentes de ICE vinieron por nuestros vecinos, familias y amigos, armados como si estuvieran en guerra. Sembraron el terror en nuestras escuelas, vecindarios y lugares de trabajo, y respondimos como siempre lo hacemos los Californianos: defendiéndonos mutuamente. 

¡Cientos de miembros de la comunidad distribuyeron miles de folletos de &quot;Conoce tus Derechos&quot; en sus vecindarios y negocios locales!

Ahora, tras la intensa escalada de violencia por parte de los agentes de ICE a principios de 2026, es más urgente que nunca prepararnos con conocimiento, atención y un plan colectivo para apoyar a nuestra comunidad.

Los Equipos en Acción de Somos California necesitan SU ayuda para llevar información crucial sobre &quot;Conoce tus Derechos&quot; a hogares en todo Los Ángeles, entregando folletos a nuestros vecinos y miembros de la comunidad. ¡Únase a esta capacitación para aprender más sobre sus derechos y cómo compartir el conocimiento en su vecindario!

¡Únase a nosotros para luchar por nuestra comunidad!</p>

<h3>Sick about ICE Terrorism? Let’s call our elected officials. Mondays, 12PM PST</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Monday, February 23, 2026 at 8:00 PM UTC - 8:30 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> CBFD Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Are you upset about the dismantling of our democracy, the violence perpetrated by I.C.E. on innocent people, the theft of millions of Americans’ private information, attacks on healthcare and social security, the Republican intent to take away a woman’s right to vote, and more? Don’t despair - take action!

One easy thing you can do that truly matters is make calls to your elected representatives, to let them know how you feel about an issue and what you expect them to do about it. Maybe you want to call your Member of Congress or your Senators but just haven’t done it yet. You know what you want, but you aren’t sure what to say.

Well, we’ve got a solution - a tool to help you make the calls, and to make your point. It’s also very rewarding because we’re doing it together. Join us every Monday on Zoom beginning January 5, 2026 at Noon Pacific time. We’ll provide all you need to make the calls - phone numbers, scripts, and training.  You’ll just need your phone, or your phone and your computer if you’d like a bigger screen for viewing.
 
We hope to see you on Zoom for this easy, effective action. Thirty minutes is all you’ll need to make sure our electeds know that we’re paying attention and demanding they take action.  There are millions of us across America - our collective voices will make a difference.  We’re in this together!</p>

<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Abel Chavez for Congress</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>We&apos;re calling voters to let them know about the importance of CA-48 to changing Congress and we&apos;re letting them know about Abel&apos;s bold economic agenda to bring immediate change to every American.  All you need is a phone, we&apos;ll provide training.

Abel will fight for:

Medicare for All, because healthcare is a human right - not a profit center; not “more affordable healthcare,” not “more accessible healthcare,” not “eventually,” not “common sense reform.” Universal healthcare for every person in America, unapologetically.

Ending corporate &amp; foreign lobbying influence, so billionaires and special interests can’t purchase policy or politician’s votes

Banning Wall Street landlords in housing, because homes are for families - not hedge funds

Strengthening public education, so every child has the opportunity for a quality education that will land them a career with zero debt.

Defund ICE.</p>

<h3>Know Your Rights with Law Enforcement on Campus</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Thursday, February 26, 2026 at 11:00 PM UTC - 12:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> State Voices Florida</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Last year, universities and colleges begun signing agreements with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), granting campus police the authority to conduct immigration enforcement. Now, 11 out of the 12 Florida Public Universities have signed this agreement, along with 7 colleges, and more stating their intent to sign on.

This collaboration raises critical concerns for immigrant students, faculty, and staff, who may face increased surveillance, questioning, and even detainment on campus.

There has also been heavy policing around students exercising their first amendment right. Due to this, all students should attend ensure they know their rights.

This &quot;Know Your Rights on Campus&quot; training is designed to empower students, educators, and community members with the knowledge and tools to protect themselves and others.

Participants will learn: 
- Understanding the legal agreements between universities &amp; ICE. 
- Your constitutional &amp; legal rights regardless of status. 
- How to respond if approached by officers. 
- Where to find Emergency plans, legal resources, and how to support peers facing enforcement actions. 
- How to push back against harmful agreements and demand an end to university-ICE collaboration.

Knowledge is power. Knowing your rights helps protect your community and resist unjust enforcement on campus.</p>

“As a lifelong Texan, a mom, a business owner, and a public servant, I’ve seen firsthand the challenges families across our state face. Sadly, our current leadership is busy tearing down our agencies and institutions, instead of building trust within our communities – both physical and demographic. I’m running for Lieutenant Governor because I believe in building a Texas that works for all of us—not just the well-connected few” – Vikki Goodwin

-- Introduction to 2026 Indivisible 1431 Strategic Plan: Richard Wayne, Steering Committee member

To be effective in 2026, Indivisible 1431 is developing a strategic plan. Richard is leading the effort, and will provide some glimpses of what’s ahead

Your contribution here helps ensure that families facing hunger have what they need, and that no one in our community is left behind. With the loss of funding for SNAP and many other important programs, these efforts are more important than ever.

And it doesn&apos;t stop here. We&apos;re encouraging our members, family, and friends to also give the gift of time and volunteer to help ensure these resources reach those who need it most.

<h3>Virtual Phonebank</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Thursday, March 5, 2026 at 1:30 AM UTC - 3:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Abel Chavez for Congress</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>We&apos;re calling voters to let them know about the importance of CA-48 to changing Congress and we&apos;re letting them know about Abel&apos;s bold economic agenda to bring immediate change to every American.  All you need is a phone, we&apos;ll provide training.

Abel will fight for:

Medicare for All, because healthcare is a human right - not a profit center; not “more affordable healthcare,” not “more accessible healthcare,” not “eventually,” not “common sense reform.” Universal healthcare for every person in America, unapologetically.

Ending corporate &amp; foreign lobbying influence, so billionaires and special interests can’t purchase policy or politician’s votes

Banning Wall Street landlords in housing, because homes are for families - not hedge funds

Strengthening public education, so every child has the opportunity for a quality education that will land them a career with zero debt.

Defund ICE.</p>

<h3>Public School Strong National Organizing Meeting</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, March 10, 2026 at 11:00 PM UTC - 12:30 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Public School Strong</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>**Over the past weeks and months, we&apos;ve seen the parents of public school kids harassed, abducted and deported on their way to pick their kids up from school.  We&apos;ve seen ICE pepper spray high school students and arrest educators on school grounds.  We&apos;re seeing proposed bills in states like Tennessee to use public schools to target immigrant families for deportation.**

**We&apos;ve also seen incredible bravery, solidarity and resilience on the part of students, parents, educators, and community members who have gone above and beyond to support and defend each other in the face of these federal invasions.**

We all have much to learn from those who have experienced these ICE surges, in cities like Durham, NC, Chicago, IL and Minneapolis, MN.

**Join us for the next Public Schools Strong organizing meeting on Tue, 2/10 to learn from leaders on the ground and get tools to protect your community and schools .**  

Public School Strong Organizing Meetings are a space for  parents, family members, educators, and public education supporters from across the nation gather each month to gain practical tools to promote, protect, and strengthen our public schools.

*If you have already attended a Public School Strong Orientation, you&apos;ll join a breakout room with current members for connection, reflection and training. If you&apos;re new, we&apos;ve got you covered too!*

### Join public school families, educators and supporters from across the country to learn how to:
1. Form a Public School Strong team in your school district
2. Engage your community to get school boards and district leaders to speak up for equitable and fully funded public schools
3. Connect your local advocacy to others for state and national impact

For more info, please visit publicschoolstrong.org

### Current Public School Strong Members

There is strength in staying connected. After completing Public School Strong (PSS) Orientation, this is your consistent space to reconnect with your peers across the country to:

1. Access helpful tools and practice relevant skills,
2. Connect the dots between what is happening locally and nationally,
3. Learn from mistakes and progress made along the way

Bring a friend!

<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p># Join Seattle Indivisible for a Critical Discussion with Senator Cantwell&apos;s Staff

Join Seattle Indivisible for an engaging Zoom discussion and Q&amp;A session with staff from Senator Maria Cantwell&apos;s office. As we navigate a complex political landscape in 2025, several key issues demand our attention:

Key Issues in 2026
🧊 Paramilitary Forces Attacking Immigrants and our Cities
ICE and CPB waging illegal, violent campaigns against immigrants and Black and brown people. 


🏛️ Constitutional Concerns
The ongoing failure of institutions to protect our rights and programs established by Congress have raised serious questions about the erosion of democratic principles.

💰 Economic Uncertainty
The imposition of a federal spending freeze has led to confusion and legal challenges, impacting various programs and contributing to fiscal instability.

⚖️ Social Equity
Policies targeting marginalized communities, including restrictions on transgender rights and potential cuts to social safety nets, underscore the ongoing struggle for social justice.

Senator Cantwell has been a vocal advocate for protecting democratic institutions, promoting economic stability, and advancing social equity. This session offers a unique opportunity to engage directly with her staff on these pressing issues.

📢 Your participation is crucial in voicing concerns and influencing decisions that impact our community.

We look forward to your active involvement in shaping the future of our state and nation!</p>

<h3>Breakfast Briefing: Defending Our Neighbors – ICE Activity, Rights and the Fight for Civil Liberties</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Wednesday, March 18, 2026 at 12:30 PM UTC - 1:30 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Represent PA</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>As immigration enforcement ramps up and civil liberties face renewed pressure, staying informed–and prepared–has never mattered more. 

On Wednesday, March 18 at 8:30 AM, join us for a timely Breakfast Briefing that meets this moment head-on. 

We’ll hear from Heidi Roux, Director of Immigrant Justice at The Welcome Project PA, who will share what’s being observed locally around ICE activity, clearly explain your rights as an observer and outline practical ways to support the most vulnerable members of our communities right now.

We’re also honored to be joined by Senator Maria Collett, who will discuss a resolution she introduced with Senator Jay Costa condemning unconstitutional use of force by federal immigration officers, as well as additional legislation she plans to introduce to confront growing threats to civil liberties.

This isn’t a passive briefing. It’s a space to get smart, ask questions and leave with clarity about what’s happening and how to respond, together.</p>
