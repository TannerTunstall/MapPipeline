<h3>Training: How to Inform Businesses of their 4th Amendment Rights</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Wednesday, February 4, 2026 at 12:00 AM UTC - 1:30 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>113 Jolly St<br>Louisburg, NC 27549</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>This a local Indivisible event!

The 4th Amendment gives business owners the right to protect their employees and customers should ICE appear at their door. Simple procedures can:
- Help minimize potentially abusive actions by immigration officers, and 
- Safeguard everyone’s legal rights
 
**Problem**: business owners are often unaware of their rights, and do not know what to do.

We can fix that! This training prepares volunteers to give local business owners and staff the information and materials they need to protect themselves.

In this training, you will:
- Learn what local businesses can do to protect staff and customers when they get a visit from ICE
- Use role-play to practice delivering this important information to business owners and staff
- Leave the training fully equipped to make a difference in the community

ICE will return to Raleigh in February. There is a real possibility that they will invade Franklin County this time around. *4th Amendment Business* outreach is an important part of our work to protect every member of our community. Come to this training and become part of the team.

*A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
<h3>February SURJ members General Meeting in the Eno River Area!</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Sunday, February 8, 2026 at 6:00 PM UTC - 8:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Durham Central Park Co-Housing<br>130 Hunt St<br>Durham, NC 27701</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Showing Up for Racial Justice</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>The right has revved up their attacks on our communities and neighbors, and now is the time fight back. 

We&apos;ll be continuing our work of **Block &amp; Build**: defending our communities from harm while building the power we need to win long-term change. We do this by focusing on two concrete areas: Strengthening and participating in [**Siembra’s organizing**](https://www.siembranc.org/) to resist government overreach and ICE raids while also moving people to action in [**SURJ’s national campaigns**](https://surj.org/current-campaigns/)



✨ **SAVE THE DATE** ✨
**Sunday, Feb 8th
1:00–2:30pm** (+ social time afterwards!)
Location will be downtown Durham. Make sure to **RSVP** so we can confirm the location with you!

**Who SHOULD attend**
Are you interested in building deeper, long-term relationships with other white people who want to fight for racial and economic justice by building power together in our community?

You don’t need prior training, organizing experience, or deep familiarity with the work. This meeting is for people who are ready to move toward action and shared responsibility—not just learning about the work. If that sounds like you, we’d love to have you.

*Introduction to SURJ: Showing Up for Racial Justice (SURJ) is a national organization that organizes white people to fight for racial and economic justice. For too long, the Right has used racism to divide us and protect the wealth and power of billionaires. Locally, we are SURJ volunteers in the Eno river area who work to turn concern into action by bringing people together to resist harm in our communities and build the skills, commitments, and collective power needed for lasting change.*</p>

<h3>ABOLISH ICE</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Thursday, February 5, 2026 at 12:30 PM UTC - 3:30 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>4601 Capital Blvd<br>Raleigh, NC 27604</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Woke County Resistance</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>**Every Thursday from 7:30 - 10:30AM**, please join the Woke County Resistance (WCR), Fayetteville Resistance Coalition (FRC), and your fellow North Carolinians to send a clear message:

▶️ **ICE and CBP have endangered our communities and taken lives.** Our neighbors fear for their livelihoods and their lives, and our communities are less safe. We won&apos;t stand for it.

▶️ **ICE has been escalating its cruel deployments into our communities.** This recent killing is not an isolated incident, but the devastating and predictable result of ICE’s lawless operations and President Trump&apos;s abuse of power.

▶️ **We demand accountability for the killing and an end to ICE and CBP raids.** We will not sit by while violence goes unanswered and our communities are terrorized.

_We will meet ICE’s violence with steadfast nonviolence and lawful protest._

<h3>Organizing Volunteers for No Kings 3 and Presentation by the co-Founder of Hagamos Vaca</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Sunday, February 15, 2026 at 7:00 PM UTC - 9:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>James City County Recreation Center<br>5301 Longhill Rd<br>Williamsburg, VA 23188</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Williamsburg JCC Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Please join us on Sunday, February 15th at 2pm at the James City County Recreation Center, located at 5301 Longhill Road, for a meeting concerning upcoming Indivisible actions, including No Kings 3 and a special presentation concerning the non-profit Hagamos Vaca.

We are extremely fortunate to have Jonathan Westmoreland, an ESL and Spanish teacher in a local public school, speak with us about the 501(c)(3) nonprofit he co-founded, Hagamos Vaca, which is rooted in this community. &quot;In Spanish, &quot;hagamos vaca&quot; means &quot;let’s chip in.&quot; It’s what you say when the problem is bigger than one person can fix, but together, we’ve got it covered. That’s exactly what we’re doing—pooling our money, time, and whatever else it takes to make sure immigrant families in New Kent, King William, James City County, Hampton Roads, and other communities have a roof over their heads, food in the fridge, and a community that has their backs.&quot;

We will also be organizing volunteers for No Kings 3 - date still not announced. We had over 6,000 people at our No Kings 2 and expect a much bigger crowd with everything occurring in our Country. Volunteer positions will include marshals, setup, sign-ins, greeters, first aid, bringing supplies, such as coolers with water/ice, etc... Please participate in some way to help facilitate a great event. Thank you!</p>

<h3>Democracy Doesn’t Wait for Spring | Vote. Then Rage</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 28, 2026 at 9:00 PM UTC - 10:30 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>251 N Main St<br>Winston-Salem, NC 27101</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Camel City United Indivisible North Carolina</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>This is a county-wide show of force on the last day of early voting.
We vote — then we gather in the streets to be seen, counted, and heard.

We’re calling hundreds of people, neighborhood by neighborhood —
from apartment communities to cul-de-sacs, churches to block groups —
to stand together and fill the space.

Our message is clear:
No fascism.
No ICE.
Yes to people power.

This isn’t one group organizing for the community.
This is the community organizing itself — and bringing its people.

Numbers matter.
Visibility matters.
Consistency matters.

Show up strong.
Stand shoulder-to-shoulder.
Make the statement.

Vote by 3.
Rage at 4.</p>

<h3>Fight for Democracy - Out with ICE  [Tysons VA]</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 7, 2026 at 4:00 PM UTC - 5:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Westpark Dr and Route 7<br>Gosnell Rd<br>Tysons, VA 22102</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Third Act and Indivisible are grassroots groups in all 50 states that believe in the possibility of change and are doing the work to make it happen.  We believe that we, the people, through our members, and along with many other organizations, and with millions of residents, can turn around the current march towards autocracy. BUT ONLY WITH YOUR HELP.

Here in Northern Virginia, we are not staying silent in the face of the attack on every institution and every racial, ethnic, and religious group in this country except those of the elites (you know who we mean).   When everything is under attack, what do we do?  Stand up and fight back.  Stand up and fight back against hatred, bigotry, racism, xenophobia, homophobia, misogyny, and antisemitism.   Stand up and fight back against the attacks on NIH, CDC, EPA, NPS, DOE, DOJ, CFPB, SSA, USAID, the Fed, universities, and law firms.  Stand up and fight back against the federal invasion of our cities and the kidnapping of hard-working, tax paying, loyal immigrants looking for a better way of life. Out with ICE!   And we do not forget about our felllow citizens of the world - the continuing and unending genocide in Gaza supported by US arms,  the unprovoked atrocities in Ukraine not defended by US arms, and the mind-numbing degree of starvation and disease in Africa caused by the cruel policy to take away the US AID humanitarian  mission.

Our Putin-loving president is in the process of taking away all of our constitutional rights and trying to take away our humanity.  STAND UP AGAINST IT ALL.  Come out with signs, banners, horns, whistles, pots and pans - whatever you can think of to get the attention of your fellow citizens who are passing by and may not be as focused as they should be on the desperate state of our democracy.  

Stand up for the Constitution for the Rule of Law.  Stand up for Humanity.

This is not the time to sit on the sidelines. This is a time for action!

This a local Indivisible event!

*A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*</p>

<h3>ICE Out For Good - Sherman Circle</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Sunday, February 1, 2026 at 8:00 PM UTC - 9:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>3700 Georgia Ave NW<br>Washington, DC 20010</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Wednesday, January 7th, an American citizen was killed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Minneapolis, Minnesota. This killing is part of a broader pattern of unchecked violence, impunity, and abuse carried out by federal immigration enforcement agencies against members of our communities. 

A broad coalition of groups across the country is calling for a coordinated Ice Out For Good Weekend of Action on Saturday, January 10th and Sunday, January 11th to demand accountability, honor the life lost, and make visible the human cost of ICE’s actions. 

A core principle behind all ICE Out For Good events is a commitment to nonviolent action and no civil disobedience. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values, and to act lawfully at these events. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events. All events should be held in public spaces or on public property.

Indivisible is managing data and communications with participants. By registering, you agree to receive info from Indivisible about the event, receive communications via e-mail or SMS message from Indivisible, and receive any other updates and opportunities to take action or support ICE OUT FOR GOOD partner organizations.

<h3>National Day of Lobbying: Impeach, Convict, and Remove - Hickory, NC</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, February 17, 2026 at 8:00 PM UTC - 9:30 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Pat Harrigan&apos;s office on campus of App State Hickory<br>800 17th St NW suite g467<br>Hickory, NC 28601</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> 50501Missouri</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>In the first week of 2026, the administration engaged in three flagrant abuses of power: (1) an unconstitutional military strike in Venezuela, (2) the extrajudicial murder of Renee Nicole Good by a member of the ICE paramilitary force for exercising her first amendment rights, and (3) the continued obstruction of justice for victims of Jeffrey Epstein’s child sex trafficking ring. 

Impeachment is not optional. It is the remedy mandated by the Constitution.

FLARE USA, Citizens&apos; Impeachment, and 50501 Movement are proud to announce the next National Day of Action: in-district lobbying on February 17, 2026 for the impeachment, conviction, and removal of President Trump. Representatives will be in their districts; catch them at home and demand they use their power to remove this unconstitutional regime!

Grassroots pro-democracy organizations (e.g., local chapters of Indivisible, Hands Off, 50501), progressive primary candidates, and other concerned citizens will join together in leading constituents into the local/in-district offices of all 435 US House Representatives to demand impeachment. 

All participants are committed to lawful, non-violent action and no civil disobedience. 

Further training materials to follow soon.</p>

<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>

Here&apos;s Your Script: feel free to add &quot;unmasking, wear and use cameras, judicial warrants for arrests...&quot;

Hi, my name is [Your Name], and I’m a constituent from [Your City, State].
I’m calling to urge Senator [Name] to refuse to vote for any appropriations bill funding the Department of Homeland Security that fails to rein in ICE.
Alex Pretti and Renee Good’s killings are unacceptable. Enough is enough.
We can’t wait around while ICE harms more people. Senator [NAME] must push for an appropriations bill that puts serious restrictions on ICE and Border Patrol, including ending racially motivated targeting, enforcement at sensitive locations, family detentions, and doesn’t add a penny to its already bloated budget.

<h3>Olney Stands Up for Democracy</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Thursday, February 5, 2026 at 10:00 PM UTC - 11:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Georgia Avenue &amp; Maryland 108<br>Olney, MD 20832</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>We stand with our neighbors for democracy, for justice, and for an economy that works for all of us, not just billionaires. We stand for science, the rule of law, a working government, kindness and common decency.

We stand on the streets so people who are fearful know they are not alone. We protest to remind ourselves that this is not normal. This is not what generations of Americans have fought and died for; we stand in the streets to honor their legacy.

We oppose fascism, tyranny, the lawless cruelty of ICE, the epic corruption, the reckless attacks on science, the idiotic tariffs, and we call out the spineless elected officials who are bending their knees to a clown who thinks only of himself.

Our protests give courage to everyone else who takes a stand. We won&apos;t back down to a clown. And when that clown goes down, we will mourn all that we have lost, and then we will rebuild on a firmer foundation. Together.

Come for your own reasons, bring your own signs or borrow one. Bring your own light or borrow one. Bring your own sounds, or dance to the protest playlist we have.

It&apos;s going to be dark and cold at 5:00, so dress warmly and maybe bring a booklight to illuminate your protest sign. To keep us all safe, we will cancel if the temperatures are below freezing, or when it rains, sleets, or snows. This is a marathon.

<h3>ICE OUT FOR GOOD Saturdays in Ocean Pines</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 7, 2026 at 7:00 PM UTC - 8:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Veterans Memorial Park<br>Race Track Rd<br>Ocean Pines, MD 21811</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Indivisible Worcester MD is extending our ICE OUT FOR GOOD demonstrations to every Saturday at 2 pm in Ocean Pines. 70 people came out on Jan 11 and 75 attended on Jan 17. We&apos;re on a roll; let&apos;s keep the momentum going!

This will be announced with other Indivisible events on mobilize.us, via email to the Indivisible Worcester mailing list (if you are not receiving email notices from us, go to http://tinyurl.com/indivisibleworcestermd to sign
up), through the Democratic Women&apos;s Club of Worcester County, and to the Indivisible Worcester Facebook group. If we need to cancel for bad weather, it will be through the above outlets.

We have a limited number of signs to share on ICE and other anti-Trump topics. If you can, please bring your own.

Parking--There is a small lot near the Veterans Memorial  that you can reach through the back of the Sports Core Pool lot.  You can also park at the public library across Cathell Rd.

A core principle behind all ICE Out For Good events is a commitment to nonviolent action and no civil disobedience. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values, and to act lawfully at these events. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events. All events should be held in public spaces or on public property.</p>

Thank you!



ICE is [expanding its operations in Baltimore](https://www.wmar2news.com/infocus/federal-contract-bids-show-ice-planning-to-expand-operations-in-maryland-during-immigration-crackdown) and we need our local leaders to do everything they can to protect the rights and safety of our immigrant neighbors! 

Act now to make sure that the Baltimore County Council passes [new immigrant protections in Baltimore County](https://www.thebanner.com/politics-power/local-government/izzy-patoka-baltimore-county-immigrants-ice-QQSHWVZAFVDLZL72BJKSJXY7E4/), including [Bill 97-25](https://countycouncilweb.s3.amazonaws.com/Bills%202025/b09725.pdf), which makes the Office of Immigrant Affairs permanent, and [Bill 98-25, the Trust Act](https://countycouncilweb.s3.amazonaws.com/Bills%202025/b09825.pdf), which specifies that county officials collect immigration data and coordinate with ICE only when required to by law, e.g. when agents have a judicial warrant or are investigating a crime. 

On January 27 at 4 pm, join us in packing the room at the public hearing on the bills and/or especially if you&apos;re an impacted community member or service provider, [sign up on the county council&apos;s website](https://countycouncil.baltimorecountymd.gov
) on the morning of January 27 to provide 3 minutes of public testimony. 

Can&apos;t make it on January 27? You can provide written testimony and/or write to your council member to express support for these important bills. Reach out to us for talking points. 

The vote on the bill is scheduled for February 2.

***Please note: Indivisible Baltimore County will be following the lead of CASA, ACLU, and organizations representing impacted communities***</p>

<h3>NO ICE POLICE TASK FORCE IN MT. HOLLY SPRINGS!!</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Sunday, February 1, 2026 at 7:00 PM UTC - 8:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>In front of Givin Library<br>114 N Baltimore Ave<br>Mount Holly Springs, PA 17065</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Mount Holly Springs Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>NO ICE POLICE TASK FORCE IN MT. HOLLY SPRINGS!! This a local Mt. Holly Springs Indivisible event!

MHS Borough Council has directed Police Chief Tom Day to begin the process of enrolling four officers into a Department of Homeland Security task-force program which deputizes local officers, while patrolling the communities they are sworn to protect, to question, detain, and arrest individuals they suspect of violating civil immigration laws.

PROTEST THIS ICE/POLICE COOPERATION IN MT. HOLLY SPRINGS! ICE IS A DANGER TO PUBLIC HEALTH AND HUMAN BEINGS. WE DON&apos;T WANT AN ICE POLICE FORCE IN MT. HOLLY SPRINGS OR PENNSYLVANIA.

A core principle behind all Mount Holly Springs Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.</p>

<h3>Focused Accountability Campaign</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Thursday, February 12, 2026 at 11:30 PM UTC - 1:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Lancaster Together</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Hope in Action Lancaster is focusing on local public officials one by one, holding them accountable for complicity with the Trump regime, or for their passivity in the face of this onslaught.

We intend to start with the Lancaster County Sheriff, who signed a 287g contract with ICE. We are looking to have folks contact the sheriff&apos;s office regularly with questions and offering their opinion in a sustained, coordinated way. We plan to use phone calls, emails, letters, and letters to the editor.

After this campaign we intend to turn our sights on other local elected officials who are culpable in the current trend towards authoritarianism. Join us for our sessions.

This meeting is every 2nd and 4th Thursday evenings of the month. It is a collaboration with Solidarity Lancaster and Indivisible Lancaster Together, but all are welcome.

**All Indivisible events are nonviolent and participants are encouraged to de-escalate any conflicts.**</p>

<h3>The People’s Day Protest</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Monday, February 16, 2026 at 5:00 PM UTC - 6:30 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Falls Park on the Reedy<br>601 S Main St<br>Greenville, SC 29601</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Upstate SC</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>On Presidents’ Day, we will protest then gather for a rally in the park to remind our community that We the People are the government. Our leaders are public servants, elected to protect us, represent us, and act in our best interests. This day is not about glorifying power, it is about remembering where power belongs, with the people. 
Across South Carolina, legislators are advancing policies that serve political ambition rather than the people. This protest is a call to expose that betrayal and remind those in office that their loyalty must be to the public, not authoritarian agendas.

Right now, controversial legislation moving through hearings includes near total abortion restrictions, efforts to close open primaries and limit voter choice, attacks on transgender students’ rights, mandates expanding ICE cooperation by local law enforcement, and changes to judicial selection that threaten court independence.

The People’s Day Protest is about dissent, accountability, and action. We refuse to be silent while democracy is weakened. We stand together to say clearly, we will not surrender our rights or our power.
This is our moment to rise, to contact our representatives, to get involved, and to make our voices impossible to ignore.

On Presidents’ Day, we choose the people. We choose freedom. We choose to dissent.</p>

<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Lancaster Together</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Communities across the country are rising up to say enough is enough after the killing of Renée Nicole Good, an unarmed American mother of three, by an ICE agent.

<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 7, 2026 at 3:00 PM UTC - 4:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Citizens Bank Branch<br>733 W Lancaster Ave<br>Bryn Mawr, PA 19010</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>This is Upper Merion Indivisible! Join us to send a message to Citizens Bank and raise awareness in our communities about Citizens&apos; role in supporting for-profit detention operators.

Citizens Financial Group, through subsidiaries like Citizens Bank, has long financed private prison and detention operators despite decades of allegations of abuse, neglect, forced labor, and fraud. Companies like GEO Group have caused widespread harm — including wrongful deaths, medical neglect, and exploitation.

Right here in Pennsylvania, GEO operates the Moshannon Valley Processing Center, the largest ICE detention facility in the Northeast. Join us-- and others statewide-- to tell Citizens Bank that we want them to stop supporting cruelty.

A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.</p>

<h3>ONE PEOPLE&apos;s No Kings 3 United Pushback</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, March 28, 2026 at 4:00 PM UTC - 6:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Summit Square Shopping Ctr<br>1717 Langhorne Newtown Rd<br>Langhorne, PA 19047</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> ONE PEOPLE</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Last year, in thousands of towns and cities across the country, millions poured into the streets for the largest single-day protest in US history. 

On March 28 we&apos;ll take to the streets again, ready to bring millions of new allies along with us to declare, in one voice: NO thugs terrorizing our neighborhoods. NO troop deployments in our streets. NO imperial wars of conquest. NO KINGS.

Trump clearly wishes to rule like a king. But -- as every community targeted by ICE and CBP has shown -- we the people refuse to cower in the face of his cruelty. This country doesn&apos;t bow down to tyrants. We sure as hell won&apos;t bow down to the kinds of wretched ghouls who kidnap children, teargas schools, and murder our neighbors then slander them as domestic terrorists.

This regime’s ongoing brutality and authoritarianism have only convinced more Americans, including many who’ve never attended a protest in their lives, to join their neighbors in the streets. Now we&apos;ve got to keep that momentum growing, with the same creativity and dogged determination.

Everything we&apos;ve done so far is the stuff of history. And together, we&apos;ll write the history of how, for the second time in 250 years, we the people defied, and overcame, a tyrant.

Once again ONE PEOPLE will do our part to fight against an Autocratic President and to Safeguard Our Democracy!</p>

<h3>Eyes on ICE: Document amd Record</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Friday, February 6, 2026 at 1:00 AM UTC - 2:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>118 N Columbus St<br>Lancaster, OH 43130</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Fairfield County Democratic Party</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>## Learn from national activists

### Discuss how we can help in Fairfield County!

On 1/24/26, federal agents horrifically shot and killed 37-year-old Alex Pretti, an ICU nurse who cared for veterans, in the Eat Street neighborhood of south Minneapolis after brutally beating him in front of witnesses.

Enough is enough. Exercising our Constitutional right to document and record ICE and other federal agents is more important than ever.
This call will give you the tools to exercise your rights in a moment when federal agents are terrorizing our communities and using excessive force.  

*This event is in-person so we can meet and discuss our role in this national effort. If you&apos;d prefer to join the national training from home,  rsvp here and the use the Zoom link in the acknowledgment reply.*</p>

<h3>Planning meeting</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Sunday, February 1, 2026 at 6:00 PM UTC - 8:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>St. Bartholomew Lutheran Church<br>1746 S Clinton Ave<br>Trenton, NJ 08610</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Happy New Year, Indivisibles!!! 
We started out 2026 with a sudden and fierce frost! But, we’re getting warmer! The Immigrant Trust Act is on Gov. Murphy’s desk as I write this! It isn’t perfect, but all the parts did pass!!  Our Pop-Up rally, ICE Out for Good was a success and with about 24 hrs to plan, 300 people came out to show their fabulous signs and resounding support for our community. 

At this meeting, we will re-group, discuss immediate and longer term plans. No Kings 3 will be in March (date: tbd).  Bring your ideas, bring your energy! 

We have been successful at coordinating with sister Indivisible groups, 50501, ICE Out of Princeton, Resistencia, St. Bart’s food ministries, etc.! We are stronger and more organized than ever! 

On the table for discussion: ICE prevention and response, elections, rallies and peaceful actions, and any ideas that you bring!

Look forward to seeing you there! 

This a local Indivisible event!

*A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*</p>

Let&apos;s make sure our neighbors know they are welcome here, regardless of their &quot;status&quot;.

        <name>National Day of Lobbying: Impeach Trump &amp; Abolish ICE</name>
        <description><![CDATA[
<h3>National Day of Lobbying: Impeach Trump &amp; Abolish ICE</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, February 17, 2026 at 8:00 PM UTC - 10:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Michael Rulli&apos;s Office<br>4137 Boardman-Canfield Rd ste 106<br>Canfield, OH 44406</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Mahoning Valley Freedom Fighters</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>In the first week of 2026, the administration engaged in three flagrant abuses of power: 
(1) an unconstitutional military strike in Venezuela, 
(2) the extrajudicial murder of Renee Nicole Good by a member of the ICE paramilitary force for exercising her first amendment rights, and 
(3) the continued obstruction of justice for victims of Jeffrey Epstein’s child sex trafficking ring. A month into 2026, the administration has escalated their unchecked aggression against allies like Greenland and countries like Cuba, Columbia, and Mexico. ICE has kidnapped preschoolers and used them as bait for their parents, and the administration is considering deploying military police to back them up.

In short: It’s not getting better and Congress is not meeting the moment.

Democracy does not defend itself; it requires the active participation of the people. While countless Americans have already called, emailed, written letters, signed petitions, and while activist organizations have brought groups to Capitol Hill calling for impeachment, this moment demands something more visible, more direct, and more powerful: constituents showing up at congressional district offices, where staff rarely, if ever, engage with constituents.

Impeachment is not optional. It is the remedy mandated by the Constitution. Likewise, Congress holds the power to de-fund and abolish ICE. They aren’t acting because they do not have the political will to do so. So we will lend them some of ours.

WHO/WHEN: Rep. Michael Rulli&apos;s Office 
4137 Boardman-Canfield Rd, Ste 106, Canfield, OH

FLARE USA, Citizens&apos; Impeachment, and 50501 Movement are proud to announce the next National Day of Action: in-district lobbying on February 17, 2026 for the impeachment of President Trump and the complete abolishment of ICE. Representatives will be in their districts; it&apos;s time to catch them at home. It&apos;s time to Remove the Regime AND abolish ICE!

Grassroots pro-democracy organizations (e.g., local chapters of Indivisible, Hands Off, 50501), progressive primary candidates, and other concerned citizens will join together in leading constituents into the local/in-district offices of all 435 US House Representatives to demand impeachment and the abolishment of ICE.</p>

- Public parking is available behind the library. 
- Bring a sign or borrow one of our extras. 
- Remember to dress warmly, the weather will be cold. 
- In case of snow, use your own best judgment and stay safe, please.</p>

<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>395 E Broad St<br>Columbus, OH 43215</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Central Ohio</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>This protest is at 395 E. Broad St, across the street from the intersection of Cleveland and Broad. There is parking in the area.  

Please note that this is not an ICE facility; it&apos;s an immigration and customs office.  We protest there to take advantage of rush hour traffic and do so after the office is closed so that we won&apos;t frighten people away from their appointments.

We provide the signs, which have red lettering on a white background and say, “Stop the Cruelty.” We all use the same sign to maximize visual impact. We are a silent protest, although we do talk among ourselves. We have a policy of not hassling ICE officers who wander by. Anger and resentment are Donald Trump&apos;s tools, they&apos;re not ours. Everyone is welcome!</p>

<h3>Protest the Cuts</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Wednesday, February 4, 2026 at 8:30 PM UTC - 9:30 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>1715 NJ-35<br>Middletown Township, NJ 07748</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Protest the Cuts Day of Action: Protect Medicaid and Stop the Billionaire Giveaway

Join Indivisible, Jersey Shore Blue, Middletown Outrage into Action, Shore Area NOW, MOCA, to protest the cuts to Medicaid and other vital programs, ICE&apos;s treatment of immigrants in NJ, and more! Unfortunately, in 2025, Rep. Chris Smith and most Republicans in Congress voted for the huge bill that will drastically cut needed Medicaid and SNAP aid to low-income Americans while giving unneeded tax cuts to billionaires. 

We are also very concerned about other federal government actions that are happening such as unlawful behavior of ICE. Until Rep. Chris Smith and the rest of Congress begins to push back against the unconstitutional actions of the Trump administration, we will protest. 

Join us Wednesday from 3:30 to dusk in front of Rep. Chris Smith&apos;s Middletown office located at 1715 Route 35! His office building is just north of the Middletown post office on 35. Look for us roadside on the grass in front of the office building&apos;s parking lot. Remember to bring your signs, your flags, and your friends!!

p.s. Please note the time change. We moved our start time earlier to 3:30 pm since Daylight Savings time began.

This a local Indivisible event!
*A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*</p>

<h3>Scrape Out ICE: Ice Scraper Protest Action</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Sunday, February 15, 2026 at 4:00 PM UTC - 5:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Home Depot<br>6017 Maxtown Rd<br>Westerville, OH 43082</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Central Ohio</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>All over the country, **ICE agents are targeting immigrants in and around Home Depot**, attacking and terrorizing workers, customers, and surrounding communities. The raids are terrifying, chaotic, and sometimes deadly.

These **atrocities are happening on Home Depot’s watch, on its properties, with its silence**. The Home Depot company has not resisted or condemned these raids.

**Join us in a buy-in action** that has been successfully implemented across the country! In groups, we will line up to make the same small purchase (89 cent putty knives as long as they last) several times. We will then line up again to return our purchases. We will hand out a list of alternative hardware stores to the customers whose shopping is disrupted, along with information about Home Depot’s complicity.

Bring $3 in cash so that the purchases and returns take more time. 

**For inspiration, check out:**

<h3>Savannah No ICE! No War!</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Friday, May 1, 2026 at 5:00 PM UTC - 7:30 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Thomas Square Park<br>99 E 35th St<br>Savannah, GA 31404</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> May Day Strong</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Trump is waging war and committing murder to enrich his billionaire backers. We are fighting to stop him. **Stand with us and take action this weekend to demand an end to the occupation of Venezuela and our cities.** 

We’re focusing on corporate targets - companies set to benefit most from the occupation of ICE or Venezuela. 

This week, our target is **Hilton Hotels**, housing this administration&apos;s ICE goons.

**We stand united demanding an end to the Venezuelan occupation and the removal of reckless untrained ICE agents from our communities.** And we&apos;re taking our fight to the companies that are backing this administration and benefiting most.

**Together we will hit these companies in their pocketbooks, force the administration to end the occupation of Venezuela and our cities and spread the word to our neighbors that we deserve better.**

Every dollar spent in wars overseas or at home is a dollar we paid for with our taxes - a dollar that could and should go to helping our communities thrive. We can have good jobs, better schools, access to healthcare and get our basic needs met. But not while our government works for billionaires and not for us.

Join us, stand strong and speak up.

*Please note: A core principle behind all our events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events*</p>

<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Join a community call to action to stop an ICE detention facility from being built in Roxbury, NJ. Show up to the city council meeting to make it clear that all of New Jersey opposes the so called &quot;Amazon warehouse for humans&quot;, and that Roxbury rejects having the detention in their backyard.

Attendees will have the option to use a three-minute public comment slot to speak directly to the council, or you can simply stand with neighbors to demonstrate unified opposition to this project. Your presence matters and visible turnout influences decisions. If you&apos;re planning to speak, please be respectful but assertive. Don&apos;t insult, don&apos;t let the rage out all the way, but let them see that it makes you angry, let them see how this is making you feel. Show them that this is wrong. Together, we are united!</p>

<h3>Malliotakis Mondays | Bay Ridge</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Monday, February 2, 2026 at 9:45 PM UTC - 10:45 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Rep. Malliotakis&apos; Brooklyn District Office<br>7716 3rd Ave.<br>Brooklyn, NY 11209</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Brooklyn</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>**Join Us for a Vigil for Minnesota &amp; Accountability**

Rep. Nicole Malliotakis recently published an op-ed proudly celebrating the “One Big Beautiful Bill” she passed—taking away people&apos;s healthcare and food assistance, while massively expanding funding for ICE to levels far surpassing agencies that pursue terrorists, drug traffickers, and violent criminals.

That funding is now powering lawless, militarized federal forces operating with impunity—killing, injuring, and drawing guns against peaceful, law-abiding people in our streets, most recently VA nurse Alex Pretti.

We will gather in a vigil to honor the brave, peaceful civic resistance of people in Minnesota and across the country, and to demand Rep. Malliotakis choose a side: the people or ICE and the architects of a violent and dehumanizing agenda of ethnic cleansing.  

---- 
_A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values._</p>

<h3>Weekly Vigil for Democracy at the Brooklyn Metropolitan Detention Center</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, February 3, 2026 at 11:00 PM UTC - 12:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>116 29th St<br>Brooklyn, NY 11232</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Brooklyn</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Join us in standing up for our neighbors, held at the notorious prison in our own back yard. For years, the Metropolitan Detention Center has had a reputation for inhumane conditions: rancid food, lack of heating in winter and oppressive heat in summer. In 2020, an inmate named Jamel Floyd was killed by corrections officers by excessive use of force. Now, ICE is using the Metropolitan Detention Center to house our immigrant neighbors -- mothers, fathers, sons and daughters -- who have been taken from their homes, schools, and workplaces and held in detention.

Our fellow organizers at Good Shepherd Lutheran Church in Bay Ridge are holding for a weekly vigil outside the MDC to call for the release of ICE detainees, and to stand against the inhumane treatment of our neighbors. Supporters are invited to bring signs, to sing or play music, and to solemnly bear witness in solidarity. Together we will build and strengthen the vital community connections.

* We gather first at the corner of 3rd Avenue and 29th Street.</p>

<h3>Forest Hills Indivisible Yard Sign Canvassing Kick-Off Meeting</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 7, 2026 at 8:00 PM UTC - 9:30 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Burns Street &amp; Yellowstone Boulevard<br>Queens, NY 11375</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Forest Hills Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Queens has always been a living mosaic — a place where families from every corner of the world have built homes, businesses, and communities side by side. Our neighborhoods are strong because of that diversity.

Please join our team! We are holding a brief canvassing training meeting to help connect with homeowners who are willing to display the “I ❤️ NY — No ICE” sign on their property.

ICE is carrying out raids, violent operations, and tactics that terrorize families, traumatize communities, and have already cost innocent people their lives, here in Queens and across the country. This brutality thrives in silence. By displaying this sign, neighbors can visibly say: this is not who we are, and not what we accept in our communities.

At the session, we’ll cover: 

Simple, respectful door-to-door outreach

Talking points grounded in Queens pride and shared community values

Sign distribution and neighborhood coordination

No experience needed — just a belief that Queens’ vast constellation of immigrant cultures is something to celebrate and defend.

Join us on Saturday, February 7th at 3 PM to kick-off this initiative. This meeting will take place in a private home in Forest Hills on Burns Street near Yellowstone Boulevard. Upon registration we will provide you with the exact address and travel instructions.</p>

<h3>Weekly Protest for an End to ICE in Cherokee County</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, February 3, 2026 at 9:00 PM UTC - 10:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Intersection of Main Street &amp; Hwy 92<br><br>Woodstock, GA 30188</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Cherokee United</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>**ICE enforcement is expanding in plain sight and in silence.**

Across the country—and here in Georgia—ICE operations rely on racial profiling, secrecy, and fear. People are detained without notice. Families are separated. Children are taken from caregivers. Communities are left in the dark while their neighbors disappear from workplaces, homes, and schools.

**This is not about safety.**

**This is about power exercised without accountability.**

When government agencies operate without transparency, targeting vulnerable people while shielding their actions from public scrutiny, democracy erodes at the local level first. What happens to immigrant communities today becomes the blueprint for broader abuse tomorrow.

That’s why we show up. Every week. Together.

** We gather to demand:** 

• No ICE presence in our neighborhoods

• An end to racial profiling and secret enforcement actions

• Transparency, accountability, and community consent

• Public safety rooted in trust—not fear

———

**📍 Intersection of Hwy 92 &amp; Main St, Woodstock, GA**

**🕓 Every Tuesday • 4–5 PM**

**📣 Indivisible Cherokee United – Activism &amp; Mobilization**

_This is a nonviolent, community-centered protest. We organize peacefully._</p>

We need EVERYONE to attend the Rockland County Legislature meeting on Tuesday, February 3, at 6:15 PM to support the Safety and Dignity for All Act. We are urging everyone to arrive EARLY to ensure everyone is able to find parking and get a seat. It&apos;s imperative that we fill the room early.

𝗥𝗼𝗰𝗸𝗹𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗖𝗼𝘂𝗻𝘁𝘆 𝗟𝗲𝗴𝗶𝘀𝗹𝗮𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝗠𝗲𝗲𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴
🗓 Tuesday, February 3 | 6:15 PM (arrive earlier for parking and seats)

📍 Allison Parris County Building

📍 11 New Hempstead Road, New City (Park in the back. Carpool if possible)

𝗥𝗦𝗩𝗣 𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗸 𝗶𝗻 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀

𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗶𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 &quot;𝗦𝗮𝗳𝗲𝘁𝘆 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗗𝗶𝗴𝗻𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗔𝗹𝗹 𝗔𝗰𝘁&quot;?
The bill sets clear limits on county cooperation with ICE by requiring judicial warrants for civil immigration enforcement, while explicitly preserving cooperation for criminal investigations. It strengthens public safety and protects immigrant families through trust and due process. This legislation is modeled on a successful law that Westchester County has had in place for eight years.

𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗢𝗽𝗽𝗼𝘀𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻
Mike Lawler, Bill Weber, and the Rockland County Republican machine are rallying their supporters to block the bill. They are using fear-mongering and &quot;sanctuary&quot; rhetoric for political gain. We cannot let them spread misinformation at the expense of our friends, neighbors, family, and safety. We need a massive turnout to stand for truth over political spin.

𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗧𝗿𝘂𝘁𝗵 𝗔𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗕𝗶𝗹𝗹:
𝗜𝘁 𝗲𝗻𝘀𝘂𝗿𝗲𝘀 𝗱𝘂𝗲 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗰𝗲𝘀𝘀: By requiring a judicial warrant signed by a judge for ICE holds, it upholds the legal standards we all rely on.

𝗜𝘁 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝘁𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘀 𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗺𝘂𝗻𝗶𝘁𝘆: Victims and witnesses can report crimes and cooperate with police without fear of being torn from their families.

𝗜𝘁 𝗱𝗼𝗲𝘀 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝘁𝗲𝗰𝘁 𝗰𝗿𝗶𝗺𝗶𝗻𝗮𝗹𝘀: The bill contains clear, explicit exceptions for any and all criminal investigations.

𝗛𝗼𝘄 𝗠𝗶𝗸𝗲 𝗟𝗮𝘄𝗹𝗲𝗿 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗼𝗽𝗽𝗼𝗻𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝘀𝗽𝗶𝗻𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗶𝘁:
❌ 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗦𝗽𝗶𝗻: They call it a &quot;Sanctuary&quot; law to imply it shields criminals.

✅ 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗥𝗲𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆: It only applies to civil immigration matters and contains clear carve-outs for criminal activity and public safety threats.

❌ 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗦𝗽𝗶𝗻:They claim it &quot;endangers the public&quot; by stopping police from doing their jobs.

✅ 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗥𝗲𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆: It actually increases safety by ensuring immigrant communities feel safe cooperating with local police to get actual criminals off the streets.

Let’s show up and stand for a Rockland that values safety and neighbors over politics. See you on Tuesday!</p>

<h3>Disappeared in America – ICE Protest</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 7, 2026 at 6:00 PM UTC - 7:30 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>9037 GA-92<br>Woodstock, GA 30189</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Across the country, families are being torn apart while billionaires and corporations cash in. This “Disappeared in America” weekend, we’re joining a national action to expose how Trump’s deportation agenda and corporate greed work hand-in-hand—disappearing our neighbors while the powerful profit.

After our regular Saturday Stand, we’ll gather on the public sidewalk in front of Home Depot to demand an end to MAGA’s regime of bullies-for-the-billionaires. Home Depot’s leadership and political donations have helped bankroll extremist candidates and policies that criminalize immigrants, silence workers, and strip away our freedoms.

We’re standing together—Black, brown, and white, native and newcomer—to say every family belongs, and no corporation should profit from fear.

Bring signs calling out deportations, corporate greed, and the billionaires funding Trump’s takeover.
Example signs:
	•	“Stop the Disappearances”
	•	“No Profits from Pain”
	•	“Home Depot: Fund Communities, Not Fascism”
	•	“Families Belong Together—In Woodstock Too”

Join us to defend our freedoms, our families, and our future.

This a local Indivisible event!

Here is where you&apos;ll describe your local event. Please be specific about important details and include anything a first time attendee, or new group member, might find helpful!

*A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*</p>

<h3>Pack Public Comment 2/5</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Thursday, February 5, 2026 at 10:30 PM UTC - 11:30 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>255 Main St 3rd floor<br>Goshen, NY 10924</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Orange County Democratic Committee</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Pack Public Comment is back, but now, thanks to our Democratic legislative majority, your impact will be amplified more than ever. The Democratic Caucus is taking on tough issues, and as one of their first acts they moved half of the regular meetings of the County Legislature to the evening. This marks the first time in 60 years where it&apos;s becoming truly accessible for our working class neighbors to make their voices heard. 

At the February 5th meeting, two key issues sponsored by Democratic Legislators will be voted on. Our margins are close, and it&apos;s crucial we make our voices heard to generate bipartisan support for what matters: 

- A resolution to OPPOSE the construction of new ICE facilities in Orange County, like the detention facility being proposed in Chester. 

- The creation of a new task force on public transportation, with the goal of making these services more accessible county-wide. 

Please use this link to RSVP, whether you intend to speak or just attend in solidarity. We will share more information on the agenda items and meeting logistics with everyone who signs up. If you plan to speak you must sign up for public comment, or have someone sign you up, by 6:00PM. 

Public comment on agenda items is at the beginning of the meeting. We encourage you to share your personal experiences and reasons why these initiatives impact you and your community.</p>

<h3>RESCHEDULED DATE - IND Cobb - ICE Out EVERYWHERE @ HD</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 7, 2026 at 7:30 PM UTC - 9:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Cumberland Parkway SE &amp; Paces Ferry Road SE<br>Vinings, GA 30339</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Cobb</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>ICE continues to escalate their brutality and lawless behavior. We will continue to stand up and send the message ICE Out Everywhere.

We are gathering at the intersection of Cumberland Pkwy SE &amp; Paces Ferry Rd SE to demand that Home Depot end its cooperation with ICE and CBP and stop allowing immigration enforcement to target day laborers on or near its properties.

For years, Home Depot parking lots have functioned as informal hiring sites for day laborers, many of whom are immigrants seeking honest work to support their families. By permitting ICE access to these spaces, Home Depot enables the intimidation, detention, and deportation of workers who are simply trying to survive.

Corporations do not exist outside of moral responsibility. When a company allows its property to be used as a site of immigration enforcement, it becomes complicit in harm - tearing families apart, destabilizing communities, and contributing to fear and exploitation of workers.

Join us in demanding Home Depot:
1.) Publicly call for an immediate end to the ICE “surge” into MN and for ICE and CBP to leave the state;
2.) The officers who killed Renee Good and Alex Pretti must be held legally accountable. Demand legitimate investigations with state involvement.
3.) Exercise their 4th Amendment rights and publicly post signage denying entrance to on-duty immigration agents who do not have signed judicial warrants as required by law, as well train staff on how to respond when immigration agents arrive at stores.
4.) Publicly call for Congress to freeze funding for ICE.

This rally is about dignity, accountability, and the right to seek work without fear. We stand in solidarity with immigrant workers and demand that Home Depot choose people over profit and justice over convenience.

* Please use discretion when choosing where to park. We encourage participants to follow posted signage and local parking regulations, to be respectful of nearby businesses and residents, and to consider patronizing local businesses when possible. *

*** A core principle behind all ICE Out For Good events is a commitment to nonviolent action and no civil disobedience. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values, and to act lawfully at these events. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events. All events should be held in public spaces or on public property. ***</p>

We stand united demanding an end to the Venezuelan occupation and the removal of reckless untrained ICE agents from our communities. 

Together we will force the administration to end the occupation of Venezuela and our cities and spread the word to our neighbors that we deserve better.

Every dollar spent in wars overseas or at home is a dollar we paid for with our taxes - a dollar that could and should go to helping our communities thrive. We can have good jobs, better schools, access to healthcare and get our basic needs met. But not while our government works for billionaires and not for us.

Join us, stand strong and speak up.

<h3>Poughkeepsie: Fight ICE, Fight Billionaires Town Hall with Antonio Delgado</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Wednesday, February 18, 2026 at 11:00 PM UTC - 1:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Cunneen-Hackett Arts Center<br>12 Vassar St<br>Poughkeepsie, NY 12601</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> For The Many</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>From ICE raids in our communities to an affordability crisis driven by corporate greed, New Yorkers are under attack. Governor Hochul has long been one of our biggest obstacles to doing anything about it. We deserve a governor who will stand with us instead of standing in our way. 

Join For the Many for a town hall with Antonio Delgado, who’s running for governor on a platform that puts everyday New Yorkers ahead of billionaires. At this event, we’ll talk about the fights we’re focused on right now: making New York stop helping ICE, tax the rich, freeze rent upstate, and take over Central Hudson—and how electing a governor who champions these issues can help us win.

Come hear directly from Delgado and other elected leaders and join our movement to win the future we deserve.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
<h3>National Day of Lobbying: Impeach, Convict, and Remove Radcliff, KY (KY-02)</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, February 17, 2026 at 7:00 PM UTC - 9:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Rep Guthrie’s Hardin County Regional Office<br>411 W Lincoln Trail Blvd<br>Radcliff, KY 40160</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> 50501Missouri</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>In the first week of 2026, the administration engaged in three flagrant abuses of power: (1) an unconstitutional military strike in Venezuela, (2) the extrajudicial murder of Renee Nicole Good by a member of the ICE paramilitary force for exercising her first amendment rights, and (3) the continued obstruction of justice for victims of Jeffrey Epstein’s child sex trafficking ring. A month into 2026, the administration has escalated their unchecked aggression against allies like Greenland and countries like Cuba, Columbia, and Mexico. ICE has kidnapped preschoolers and used them as bait for their parents, and the administration is considering deploying military police to back them up.

In short: It’s not getting better and Congress is not meeting the moment. 

Democracy does not defend itself; it requires the active participation of the people. While countless Americans have already called, emailed, written letters, signed petitions, and while activist organizations have brought groups to Capitol Hill calling for impeachment, this moment demands something more visible, more direct, and more powerful: constituents showing up at congressional district offices, where staff rarely, if ever, engage with constituents.

Impeachment is not optional. It is the remedy mandated by the Constitution.

WHO/WHEN:

FLARE USA, Citizens&apos; Impeachment, and 50501 Movement are proud to announce the next National Day of Action: in-district lobbying on February 17, 2026 for the impeachment, conviction, and removal of President Trump. Representatives will be in their districts; catch them at home and demand they use their power to remove this unconstitutional regime!

Grassroots pro-democracy organizations (e.g., local chapters of Indivisible, Hands Off, 50501), progressive primary candidates, and other concerned citizens will join together in leading constituents into the local/in-district offices of all 435 US House Representatives to demand impeachment. 

Please see our attendee guide for more information on why we&apos;re mobilizing, specific goals, current news on impeachment, and a full guide, including scripts, for visiting and following up with your Representative&apos;s office at tinyurl.com/lobby217guide. 

By registering for the event, you are agreeing that event partners may receive your contact information and communicate with you about related activities. 

All participants are committed to lawful, non-violent action and no civil disobedience.</p>

Every dollar spent in wars overseas or at home is a dollar we paid for with our taxes - a dollar that could and should go to helping our communities thrive. **We can have good jobs, better schools, access to healthcare and get our basic needs met. But not while our government works for billionaires and not for us.**

Join us, stand strong and speak up. 

*Please note: A core principle behind all our events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events*</p>

<h3>Fight ICE, Fight Billionaires Town Hall with Antonio Delgado</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Wednesday, February 18, 2026 at 11:30 PM UTC - 1:30 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Senate Garage<br>4 North Front St<br>Kingston, NY 12401</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> For The Many</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>From ICE raids in our communities to an affordability crisis driven by corporate greed, New Yorkers are under attack. Governor Hochul has long been one of our biggest obstacles to doing anything about it. We deserve a governor who will stand with us instead of standing in our way. 

Join For the Many for a town hall with Antonio Delgado, who’s running for governor on a platform that puts everyday New Yorkers ahead of billionaires. At this event, we’ll talk about the fights we’re focused on right now: making New York stop helping ICE, tax the rich, freeze rent upstate, and take over Central Hudson—and how electing a governor who champions these issues can help us win.

Come hear directly from Delgado and other elected leaders and join our movement to win the future we deserve.</p>

<h3>Vigil for Victims of ICE</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, February 3, 2026 at 10:00 PM UTC - 11:30 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Corydon Christian Church<br>216 N Mulberry St<br>Corydon, IN 47112</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Vigil for the Victims of ICE

Our community is hurting. We have lost Alex, Renee, and Keith, and their absence has left a deep ache in the hearts of those who knew and loved them. In this difficult time, we want you to know: you do not have to grieve alone.

We invite you to join us for a peaceful, nonpartisan vigil as we gather to honor their lives, mourn their passing, and hold space for one another. 

There will be speakers sharing words of remembrance, music to help carry our sorrow, and moments of quiet reflection as we stand together in solidarity.

If you are able, please bring a candle or a small light to help illuminate the evening. Weather permitting, we hope to walk together around the town square as a gesture of remembrance and unity; however, this will depend on conditions that day.

Location: Corydon Christian Church
216 N Mulberry St, Corydon, IN 47112
Time: 5:00pm – 6:00pm

This vigil is hosted by Progressive Voices H.C.F. in partnership with Harrison County Democrats and Indivisible Southern Indiana.

All are welcome. May we find comfort in community and strength in each other as we remember Alex, Renee, and Keith.

*A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*</p>

<h3>A Nationwide Gathering for a National Vigil and Protest DHS, ICE &amp; CBP</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Sunday, February 15, 2026 at 9:00 PM UTC - 10:30 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>4250 Federal Dr<br>Batavia, NY 14020</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Genesee Valley Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Organized by Rev. Leah Ntula   revntula5@gmail.com

WHO: Community members; the public is encouraged to attend.

WHAT: A community vigil and protest. A Nationwide Gathering for a National Vigil and Protest  
On Sunday, February 15, members of local communities across the United States will gather simultaneously for a national vigil and peaceful protest against the violence of ICE, Customs and Border Protection, and other federal agencies. The event aims to honor those who have lost their lives, and to resist the normalization of this behavior as the “new normal.&quot;
The demonstration will include a candlelight vigil, the reading of a list of names, and a protest. Those in attendance are encouraged to lie down—or remain still in their chair, walker, or while standing—and remain motionless for 36 minutes, one minute for each name.  [Sadly, there are now more than 36 names.]

WHY: To remember those who have lost their lives and those who mourn them, and to unite in an act of resistance and courage against the normalization of the actions—or inactions—of these agencies and the federal government.</p>

<h3>Pop up demonstration for the protection of OUR Constitution</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 7, 2026 at 4:00 PM UTC - 5:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Assemble on public sidewalks at intersection of<br>Onondaga Road &amp; West Genesee Street<br>Fairmount, NY 13219</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Onondaga County</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>To protectors of the US Constitution,

Mark Twain wrote, “Patriotism is supporting your country all of the time and your government when it deserves it”. We currently have a government regime led by a cruel, corrupt, lawless pathological liar supported by a group of authoritarian gaslighting sycophants. This regime does not deserve our support. It deserves our resistance!

The Framers of the U.S. Constitution created the Bill of Rights and placed Freedom of Assembly, Speech, and Petition of government grievances in the First Amendment in order for action to be taken in times like these.

EVERY SINGLE DAY this regime is violating our Constitution. This regime is invading sovereign countries. Masked lawless federal “agents” are kidnapping our neighbors and now killing citizens in our neighborhoods.

To be clear, we respect and appreciate ethical and community-minded law enforcement officers. We RESIST brutality, lawlessness, and lack of accountability by ICE.

This rally is part of a campaign of recurring “pop-up” rallies at various locations throughout Onondaga County Saturdays 11-12pm. New weekly location will be announced every Monday for that Friday. Raise your voice with a community of protectors of the Constitution and human rights by peacefully assembling together to exercise our First Amendment rights!

In the influential footsteps of Gandhi,  Dr. King, Thich Nhat Hahn, and Susan B Anthony, non-violence is not only a strategy for direct action to save our democracy, but a shared value in our personal conduct. We are a peaceful, yet assertive movement. Any suggestion otherwise is propaganda. We denounce political violence in the clearest and strongest possible terms. 

Additionally, we are an organization of VOLUNTEER activists, organizers, concerned community members, and other protectors of our Constitution. We care about our community and our country. We RESIST authoritarianism from the megalomaniac in the White House. We are NOT paid. Any suggestion otherwise is propaganda. 

In solidarity,

Chad</p>

<h3>We the People Dissent Bi-Monthly Grand Circus Protest THEMED: ABOLISH ICE</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Sunday, February 1, 2026 at 6:00 PM UTC - 7:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Grand Circus Park<br><br>Détroit, MI 48226</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>2/1 THEME: ABOLISH ICE.
Join us for an hour of action at Grand Circus Park in Downtown Detroit. Let&apos;s give the resistance in Detroit some good visibility, educate people about the democratic crisis we are deep in with flyering and conversations. We have banners, but feel free to bring your best sign! Make sure you come with water and a snack in your backpack, warm gloves, several layers of sweaters under your winter coat, long johns, scarf, and winter hat. Heated socks sound like a good idea too.

At 1PM, we will start at the corner of Adams &amp; Woodward, just next to Central Methodist Church. We may decide to move to a different corner depending on where the crowd flows, but the meeting point at 1 PM is just outside the Church!

On Sundays, street parking is free. If you cannot find street parking available near Grand Circus, we recommend that you drive up Woodward a bit, where you can park anywhere for free, then hop on the Q-Line (free too!) to Grand Circus. 

*A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*</p>

The event overlooks key parts of U.S. history, including struggles for representation, opposition to authoritarian rule, and more importantly resistance to FASCISM.</p>

<h3>Citizens Bank: STOP FUNDING ICE PRISONS</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 7, 2026 at 4:00 PM UTC - 5:30 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Citizens Bank<br>354 Broad St<br>Manchester, CT 06040</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Quiet Corner Indivisible-CT</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>ICE relies on private prison companies to build and operate their inhumane immigration detention facilities. Those private prison companies, in turn, rely on financial institutions -- institutions like Citizens Bank. Citizens Bank is complicit in the evils of the private prison industry; we want to persuade them that this is bad for business, and that a &apos;community bank&apos; shouldn&apos;t be supporting immigration jails.

We&apos;ll gather on the public sidewalk in front of the Citizens Bank branch at 354 Broad Street in Manchester CT on February 7, from 11:00-12:30. Cancellation only for severe weather. Please park nearby, e.g. in the larger shopping area down/across the street (near Ollie&apos;s), rather than parking in the bank parking lot.

Please bring signs specific to this action: Cages Aren&apos;t Communities; Citizens Bank - Stop Financing ICE Prisons; Citizens Bank + ICE = Human Rights Abuse; ICE Prisons - Bad For Communities; Citizens Bank- Divest From ICE; Your Deposits Support Private Prisons, etc. Use your imagination, but please stay on topic.

Notorious private prison companies The GEO Group and CoreCivic are expected to be part of an unprecedented expansion in capacity as part of the Trump administration&apos;s mass detention, deportation, and surveillance policies.

To accommodate this planned increase in detention capacity, GEO and CoreCivic must undertake expensive construction and renovation projects. Since 2019, though, most of their lenders have cut ties with the two companies, which have faced allegations ranging from forced labor to securities fraud.​

In sharp contrast, ​Citizens Bank has embraced its growing relationship with the private prison industry, taking on new roles in financing both CoreCivic and GEO -- all the while advertising their commitment to strengthening our communities.

A core principle behind this event is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values and to act lawfully at these events. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events. Please do not block business entrances or traffic.

This event is sponsored by Quiet Corner Indivisible-CT, CT 50501, Sarah Harris Was Here, Thread City Indivisible, and MA/CT Stop Avelo.</p>

<h3>Candlelight Vigil</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Monday, February 2, 2026 at 10:30 PM UTC - 11:30 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>10 Mile Road &amp; Coolidge Highway<br>Oak Park, MI 48237</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Oak Park Concerned Citizens</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>We are inviting you to join us at a candlelight vigil to memorialize and honor those who have died in ICE detention, those who have died at the hands of ICE on our city streets, and the countless whom ICE has disappeared.  This vigil is a space for mourning, remembrance, and solidarity with the families and communities who continue to carry this loss. By gathering together, we affirm the dignity of every life and bear witness to the human cost of these policies.  We will say their names.

Date: Monday, February 2

Time:  5:30-6:30 pm

Location:   10 Mile &amp; Coolidge, Southeast corner

Vigil candles will be provided, but with the understanding that they might not withstand the mild wind expected that evening.  We encourage everyone to either bring a backup flashlight or battery candle, or use the flashlight on your phones.  We will provide luminaries to border our circle.  We will also provide a few poems to be read by those who are willing.  Feel free to bring anything appropriate for a vigil that you would like to read.
  
If you decide to attend, please dress for the weather.  Consider multiple, multiple layers;  foot and handwarmers; balaclava, scarf or neck gator.  We want everyone to be safe, while showing solidarity for those in Minnesota who have withstood subzero temps during their recent candlelight vigils.   

For those who are interested in streetside protesting during daylight hours, feel free to do so between 4:30-5:30 pm.  However, the vigil will begin at 5:30 pm, at which time any protesting will end.</p>

<h3>Indivisible Albany&apos;s Forum on the Police State: What the Flock?</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Monday, February 9, 2026 at 11:00 PM UTC - 1:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Love Albany Center<br>8 Kate St<br>Albany, NY 12209</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Join Indivisible Albany as we kick off our first meeting of 2026 with a forum on the rise of the Police State in America.

Over the past several decades, the United States has experienced a steady and often quiet expansion of surveillance that has reshaped the relationship between the government and the public. What began as targeted intelligence gathering has evolved into a vast ecosystem of data collection, enabled by digital technologies, private-sector partnerships, and national security policies that prioritize preemption over transparency. A striking example of this shift is the rapid adoption of automated license plate reader systems produced by Flock Safety, now deployed by thousands of police departments, public and private entities across the country. The Capital District has seen a rise in the use of Flock cameras, including within the City of Albany, often without meaningful public consent or oversight.

We will discuss how Flock camera systems work, where they are, how the data is retained and, more importantly, how this data is being funneled to federal agencies such as ICE to target and track immigrant communities. We will also discuss actions that you can take to fight back against the installation of Flock cameras and demand accountability for those already in use.</p>

<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Monroe County Public Library - Ellettsville Branch<br>600 W Temperance St<br>Ellettsville, IN 47429</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible South Central Indiana</p>

The &quot;Refugees 101&quot; training from Exodus Refugee Immigration originally planned for the February meeting will be rescheduled for sometime in March, exact date TBD.

Please arrive by 2:45pm so we can get everyone signed in and start the meeting promptly at 3:00pm.

### Guest Speaker
We will be joined by Sheriff Ruben Marté to hear his vision for law enforcement in Monroe County. Marté has been protecting the rights of our immigrant neighbors by refusing to honor unconstitutional ICE holds.

### In-Meeting Action
Our friends from Exodus Refugee Immigration, Inc. will update us on immigration-related legislation currently active in the Indiana statehouse and actions you can take to support good bills and oppose those that harm our immigrant neighbors.

### ISCI Photography &amp; Video Policy
ISCI may take photos or videos at meetings and events to document, share, and promote our activities. When taking photos or videos, ISCI representatives will do their best to seek explicit consent before photographing individuals with their faces or names visible. We ask all participants taking personal photos or videos to seek consent as well and respect the wishes of those who do not want to be photographed or recorded. **Please note that in public settings, including protests, there is always the possibility of being identifiably photographed.** Ultimately, the responsibility for protecting our identity lies with each of us individually. If you are concerned about being photographed or recorded during Indivisible activities, we strongly encourage you to cover your face and other identifiable features.</p>

<h3>South County Rising OVERPASS BRIGADE - Exeter RI</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 28, 2026 at 4:00 PM UTC - 5:30 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>130 Austin Farm Rd<br>Exeter, RI 02822</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> South County Rising RI</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>This is a SOUTH COUNTY RISING event!

Saturday, February 28, we remember Renee Nicole Good &amp; Alex Pretti and all the victims of ICE and the Trump Regime.  Stand With Us while we demand an end to ICE cruelty in our country!

South County Rising protesters will gather at Austin Farm Rd in Exeter at the Rt 95 overpass.  

***Setup is at 11AM &amp; the brigade will run from 11:30AM to 12:30PM.***

There&apos;s plenty of parking on both sides of the Road. 
We will provide letters to hold and large flags.

To get there:  Put 130 Austin Farm Road Exeter in your GPS.  

From Hope Valley, head north on Rt. 3 (Nooseneck Hill Rd.) for about 7 miles. Austin Farm Road is a left turn after RT 165 intersection - before you get to Victory Highway, Rt. 102. The overpass is not far from the turn on Austin Farm Road. 

From the North on 95South, take Exit 14A toward NK/Exeter to Rt. 3 South.  Turn Right onto Rt 3 South and Austin Farm Road is the first right after the light.

A core principle behind all South County Rising events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.</p>

<h3>Stop Citizens Bank From Financing Private ICE Prisons</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Friday, February 6, 2026 at 5:00 PM UTC - 6:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Public sidewalk on King Street in front of Stop and Shop Plaza<br>228 King St<br>Northampton, MA 01060</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Northampton-Swing Left Western MA</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Weather permitting - we will cancel if heavy snow or low wind chill. Dress very warmly please.  

Send Citizens Bank a clear message: financing private prison and immigration detention facility operators The GEO Group and CoreCivic is bad for business.

We&apos;ll stand out on the public sidewalks on King Street Northampton, in front of Stop and Shop Plaza (Citizens Bank has a branch inside Stop and Shop). 

Please only bring signs specific to this action: De-ICE Citizens Bank; Cages Aren&apos;t Communities; Citizens Bank - Stop Financing ICE Prisons; Citizens Bank + ICE = Human Rights Abuse; ICE Prisons Don&apos;t Strengthen Our Communities; Citizens Bank- Cut Ties With ICE Prisons; etc. We&apos;ll try to have some extras too.

Notorious private prison companies The GEO Group and CoreCivic are being called on to be part of an unprecedented expansion in capacity as part of the Trump administration&apos;s mass detention, deportation, and surveillance policies. 

To accommodate the planned increase in detention capacity, GEO and CoreCivic must undertake expensive construction and renovation projects. Since 2019, though, most of their lenders have cut ties with the two companies, which have faced allegations from forced labor to securities fraud.​

​Citizens Bank has instead deepened its relationship with the private prison industry, taking on new roles in financing both CoreCivic and GEO, all while continuing to tell their customers that they&apos;re focused on strengthening our communities.

We won&apos;t quietly stand by as Citizens continues to finance the private prison &amp; ICE detention companies that are harming our communities. The 2019 exodus of banks from the industry in response to activism should be a reminder to us that our voices matter. Now it&apos;s time to use them.

<h3>Home Depot--Say NO to ICE, (New location!)</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 7, 2026 at 5:00 PM UTC - 6:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>25 Russell St<br>Hadley, MA 01035</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Northampton-Swing Left Western MA</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>We&apos;re continuing our Home Depot standouts--but we are combining forces with our friends who are standing out at the same time down the road, also protesting the treatment of migrant workers.  So please join us there!

Please bring signs specific to not buying from Home Depot.  And please sign up--if the weather turns out to be terrible, we can let you know if we have to cancel.
 
ICE has been targeting Home Depot parking lots across the country, where day labor people (often immigrants) gather to pick up work.  ICE just swoops in and grabs people.  Home Depot&apos;s response--silence.   So we are telling people to boycott Home Depot until they tell ICE to stay out of their parking lots (which are their private property.)</p>

JOIN YOUR NEIGHBORS ~ USE YOUR VOICE!

## EVERY Friday, from 3:00-4:00 on most overpasses. ##

**Please check weather conditions beforehand.** Overpasses may not be clear of ice and snow during winter months. Please only stand and hang banners if conditions are safe to do so.

Freedom for All. Justice for All. NO KINGS.

If you believe in Demanding Due Process for All

If you believe in Remaining a Democracy instead of having a King

If you believe in Having an Efficient, Effective government that Respects its Citizens

If you believe ICE is NOT immune from following the LAW

If you believe we&apos;ve shed Enough Blood for Oil and Power

If you believe the Epstein Files need to be released NOW

**NOW is the time to voice your concern. Join Us in Protest of What&apos;s Happening!**

Exit 2 is the only overpass where many protesters with signs are appropriate. Other overpasses are better for banners and flags and fewer people BUT we do welcome people to come to other overpasses and share the energy!


- Tyler Hill Road I-91 overpass
- Western Ave Exit 2, South side of the I-91 bridge overpass - Please do not park or stand anywhere near the Deli OR block ANY driveways. PLEASE Respect Our Neighbors!

Bring Yourself, a Friend, your Kids, a Sign, a Banner on POSTS, a Flag or Upside down flag to support your community!

Voice your opposition to the threat on OUR Democracy, our Community and our Environment!

These protests are Self-Policed.  Please keep yourself and your fellow protesters safe. Stay alert.  

**A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.**

<h3>ICE OUT HOME DEPOT NATICK WEEKLY Saturdays 1-2p</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 7, 2026 at 6:00 PM UTC - 7:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Natick Home Depot @ Cochituate Rd Enterance<br>Cochituate Rd<br>Framingham, MA 01701</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Metro Boston Indivisible Coaltion</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>WEEKLY SATURDAYS at 1-2 pm Natick Home Depot Cochituate Rd

We will cancel If temperature is &lt; 32 degrees OR severe winter storm warnings

Standing out Home Depot Natick Cochituate Rd entrance sending a clear message to stop allowing ICE raids on their property and to boycott shopping there! Tell the Trump administration we don&apos;t stand for illegal deportations!

All over the country, ICE agents are targeting immigrants in and around Home Depot, and these atrocities are happening on Home Depot’s watch, on its properties, with its silence.

The Home Depot has not publicly resisted or condemned these raids or demanded that the Administration stop assaulting and abducting people on and outside its properties. With its silence and inaction, Home Depot has become ICE’s passive partner. 

In order to show up for immigrant community members and defeat authoritarianism, we must engage in the dual strategy of electing people who will stand up to Trump, and engaging in noncooperation (also known as civil resistance). Movements with no civil resistance actions, stopping democratic backsliding only happens 7.5% of the time. With a civil resistance added to the movement, that percentage goes up to 51.7%! 

In addition to this, we need to run civil resistance campaigns that hit the power holders where it hurts! When we do symbolic actions like one day protests and vigils, which are useful in their own way, power holders can easily ignore them. When we engage in actions that cost money like a boycott, cost elected leaders their seats, or stop business as usual, they are far more likely to respond. So we engage in noncooperation because we must impose real and tangible costs to powerholders&apos; bottom-lines!

A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.

Suggested signs:
ICE out of Home Depot 
We Ain’t Buying it - stand with immigrant neighbors!</p>

<h3>Citizens Bank: Stop Financing ICE Prisons!</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 7, 2026 at 4:00 PM UTC - 5:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Public sidewalks near three Citizens Bank branches in Cambridge MA:  Central Square, 689 Massachusetts Ave, 02139 // Harvard Square, 30 Brattle St. 02138 // Porter Square, 822 Somerville Ave, 02140<br>30 Brattle St<br>Cambridge, MA 02138</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Progressive Mass Cambridge</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>This event is organized locally by the Cambridge chapter of the regional De-ICE Citizens Bank Coalition. 

Citizens Bank publicly presents itself as a community-centered institution committed to social responsibility. Yet the Bank continues to maintain key financial relationships with CoreCivic and The GEO Group, two notorious, for-profit, prison corporations that build and operate immigration detention facilities for ICE, provide transportation services to ICE, and operate prisons for mass incarceration. 

For more details about Citizens Bank’s relationship to the private prison system, go to boycottcitizens.org 

In response, the De-ICE Citizens Bank Coalition (de.ICE.CitizensBank@gmail.com), presently comprising progressive organizations from MA, CT, VT, RI, NY, NJ, PA, DE, and DC, is holding informational standouts near Citizens Bank branches.

The Coalition calls upon Citizens Bank to live up to its stated values by publicly committing to end its financial relationships with private prison and detention contractors as soon as legally possible. These actions are intended to send a clear message: corporations and financial institutions that enable harmful immigration and detention policies must be held accountable by the communities they claim to serve.

We&apos;ll stand out on the public sidewalks at Citizens Banks with signs and informational leaflets.  We will urge Citizens Bank customers to contact their local branch managers and relevant executives of the Bank about the investments in ICE and to tell Citizens they may be closing their accounts.

Please only bring signs specific to this action, such as: 
Citizens Bank: Stop Financing ICE Prisons! // ICE Cages Aren&apos;t “Communities” // Citizens Bank + ICE = Human Rights Abuse // “Strengthen Our Communities”? Not with ICE Prisons! // Citizens Bank: Cut Ties With ICE.

We&apos;ll have some extra signs.

Dress for the weather. Bring hand/foot warmers if you need them. Unless it is unsafe, we plan to be out in solidarity with activists around the country who won&apos;t let weather deter them! Sign Up to be notified of any cancellation. 

A core principle behind all of these events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values and to act lawfully at these events. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events. Please do not block business entrances or traffic.</p>

<h3>National Day of Lobbying: Impeach, Convict, and Remove Boston</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, February 17, 2026 at 2:00 PM UTC - 12:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br><br>Boston, MA 02108</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> 50501Missouri</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Please note this event is not finalized. Details will be provided as the event takes shape. Time and location are subject to change.

In the first week of 2026, the administration engaged in three flagrant abuses of power: (1) an unconstitutional military strike in Venezuela, (2) the extrajudicial murder of Renee Nicole Good by a member of the ICE paramilitary force for exercising her first amendment rights, and (3) the continued obstruction of justice for victims of Jeffrey Epstein’s child sex trafficking ring. 

Impeachment is not optional. It is the remedy mandated by the Constitution.

FLARE USA, Citizens&apos; Impeachment, and 50501 Movement are proud to announce the next National Day of Action: in-district lobbying on February 17, 2026 for the impeachment, conviction, and removal of President Trump. Representatives will be in their districts; catch them at home and demand they use their power to remove this unconstitutional regime!

Grassroots pro-democracy organizations (e.g., local chapters of Indivisible, Hands Off, 50501), progressive primary candidates, and other concerned citizens will join together in leading constituents into the local/in-district offices of all 435 US House Representatives to demand impeachment. 

All participants are committed to lawful, non-violent action and no civil disobedience. 

Further training materials to follow soon.</p>

## Bearing Witness, Building Hope

### Quaker public witness has stood in opposition to cruel and authoritarian actions in our country before. It is time for us to show this love in action again. 

Please join the American Friends Service Committee to bear witness and show resistance to the authoritarian actions in our country. 

On February 21st at 11AM EST we will gather at Odell Veterans Memorial Park for one hour of public worship and peaceful standout. 

Our hope is that our presence will give hope to all who see us – to show that we can choose resistance - and remind everyone of our moral obligations to one another.

We gather monthly in communities across the country, showing our communities love in action as a public witness of our Quaker values in a time of rising fascism.

Join us! Bring Palestine Flags 🇵🇸 or an Abolish ICE Sign. Bring your friends, your families, your kids, your students, your classmates, your teachers, and anyone else you know as we send a clear message to this administration and congress. 

To find our more about Love as Action nationally and get more resources visit us at afsc.org/love-action</p>

<h3>HANDS OFF GREENLAND 🇬🇱 ICE OUT OF OUR COMMUNITIES [Rally + Standout]</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, March 7, 2026 at 4:00 PM UTC - 5:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Odell Veterans Memorial Park<br>56-98 Broadway<br>Beverly, MA 01915</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Swing Left</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Trump is waging war and committing murder to enrich his billionaire backers. We are fighting to stop him. Stand with us and take action this weekend to demand an end to the occupation of Greenland, Ukraine and our cities.

We’re focusing on corporate targets - companies set to benefit most from the occupation of ICE or Greenland.

We stand united demanding an end to the Greenland occupation and the removal of reckless untrained ICE agents from our communities. And we&apos;re taking our fight to the companies that are backing this administration and benefiting most.

Together we will hit these companies in their pocketbooks, force the administration to end the occupation of Greenland our cities and spread the word to our neighbors that we deserve better.

Every dollar spent in wars overseas or at home is a dollar we paid for with our taxes - a dollar that could and should go to helping our communities thrive. We can have good jobs, better schools, access to healthcare and get our basic needs met. But not while our government works for billionaires and not for us.

Join us, stand strong and speak up.

Please note: A core principle behind all our events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events</p>

<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Wednesday, January 7th, an American citizen was killed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Minneapolis, Minnesota. This killing is part of a broader pattern of unchecked violence, impunity, and abuse carried out by federal immigration enforcement agencies against members of our communities.

A core principle behind all ICE Out For Good events is a commitment to nonviolent action and no civil disobedience. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values, and to act lawfully at these events. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events. All events should be held in public spaces or on public property.

***Where and When?***
On the corners of 441 and Donnelly in Mount Dora, Florida 32757
Sunday, February 1, 2026  - 2:00pm-3:30pm

***How?***
Bring an ant-ICE sign to wave. You can also bring an instrument if you want to play, music and maybe wear a costume if you feel like it. 
Parking by Wendy&apos;s and the CF Fitness plaza or McDonald&apos;s side where Key Food shopping center.

***Why?***
The death of Alex Pretti was the final straw of the abominable actions of the DHS under Kristi Noem! We are demanding that the US Senate totally defund ICE and for Congress to institute impeachment proceedings against Kristi Noem! What is happening is un-American acts perpetrated against the people in our country and against our Constitutional Rights.

<h3>Canvass with Aaron Lewis - Talk to Orange County Residents</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 7, 2026 at 2:30 PM UTC - 5:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Southwest Corner of Fashion Square<br>3201 E Colonial Dr<br>Orlando, FL 32803</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Aaron Lewis for Orange County District 7 Commissioner</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>🚨 **UPDATE: SATURDAY ACTION PLAN** 🚨

Instead of canvassing this Saturday, we’re joining the **ICE Out of Orlando** peaceful protest and asking volunteers to **help collect signatures** during the event.

This is a powerful opportunity to connect with community members who are already engaged and ready to take action.

**📅 Saturday, January 31**  
**⏰ 12:00–3:00 PM**  
**📍 Southwest Corner of Fashion Square Mall**  
3201 E Colonial Dr, Orlando, FL 32803

**✍🏽 What we need from volunteers:**  
• Help collect signatures  
• Engage respectfully with attendees  
• Support a peaceful, community-driven action

**🧥 Important note:**  
Due to **extreme cold weather**, **Sunday canvassing has been canceled** for everyone’s safety.

If you can make it on Saturday, dress comfortably, bring a charged phone, and come ready to make an impact. Instructions and support will be provided on site.

**This is how change happens—together, in community, and in public.**  
Hope to see you there. 💙✊🏽

------------------------

**Meet Neighbors. Share Information. Build Community Power.**

District 7 is changing—and many neighbors don’t know it yet.

Join **Team Aaron** as we knock doors across the **newly redrawn district** to help residents understand:

- What the district changes mean for them  
- Who will represent them next November  
- How we can build a stronger Orange County together  

This is about connection, clarity, and community—not pressure or politics-as-usual.

---

## **What We’ll Be Talking About**

At the doors, we’ll focus on the issues residents care about most:

- **Affordable housing** that keeps families stable  
- **Better transit** that actually connects our neighborhoods  
- **Resilient infrastructure** that protects our shared future  

Above all, we’ll remind people that **county government works best when it works with the people who live here**.

---

## **No Experience Needed**

Never canvassed before? No problem.

We’ll make sure you’re set up for success:

- Quick training before we head out  
- Option to canvass with a partner  
- All materials and talking points provided  

This is a welcoming, supportive environment focused on positive conversations.

---

## **What to Bring**

- Comfortable shoes  
- A charged phone  
- Your passion for making a difference  

We’ll take care of the rest.

---

## **Why This Matters**

Talking with neighbors—face to face—is how trust is built and change happens. Every conversation helps ensure District 7 residents are informed, empowered, and ready to shape their future.

**Join us and be part of the movement.**</p>

<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Attention New Hampshire - Rockingham County Jail intends to house ICE detainees and this may even begin in the next couple of weeks. There is currently a contract on the table so we need to act fact fast to STOP THIS NOW before that contract is executed.

We need to **SHOW UP** at the weekly Commissioners Meeting to let them know that we DO NOT want ICE in our communities!

Please plan to show up at 12:00 PM to protest outside, then as many of us as possible will fill up the meeting. We must make it clear that Granite Staters are against ICE in every way!

Additionally, the Rockingham County DEMS are holding a community session on this issue on Feb. 5th @ 7:00 PM. Our groups will be at the session as well. We plan to meet for vigil and visibility from 6-7PM prior to the session. Learn more here: https://www.mobilize.us/indivisible/event/891933/

<h3>Abolish ICE Rally</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Sunday, February 1, 2026 at 8:00 PM UTC - 10:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>U.S. 1 &amp; Florida 520<br>Cocoa, FL 32922</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> BrevardDems</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Please join us this Sunday, February 1st at 3:00 PM at the corners of 520 and US-1 to peacefully stand against the brutality being carried out by the Trump administration, CBP, and ICE.

We are gathering in response to the murders of Renee Nicole Good, Keith Porter Jr., and Alex Pretti. Renee should still be alive. Alex — an ICU nurse, a caregiver, a man who stepped in to protect others — should still be here. Keith Porter Jr. was killed on New Year’s Eve by an off-duty ICE officer. These were not tragic accidents. They were the predictable result of state violence and a system that refuses accountability.

This rally is about drawing a line. About rejecting the normalization of cruelty. About saying we will not accept a government that treats human lives as expendable and then shrugs when people are killed.
This action is sponsored by Awake Brevard and SCDSA. Show up. Bring your voice. Bring your anger and your grief. Stand with us for Renee. For Alex. For Keith. For everyone who could be next.

Sunday, February 1 • 3:00 PM
Corners of 520 &amp; US-1

This march is part of Good Trouble Indivisible’s ongoing regional “SIGNS OF FASCISM” series across West Michigan.

Residents are encouraged to join us. (We have combined our ICE OUT FOR GOOD March with our SIGNS OF FASCISM March.)

Good Trouble Indivisible invites you to participate in one of our most powerful nonviolent actions: a silent performance march called SIGNS OF FASCISM will be our first lap through the downtown area. The second lap through the downtown will represent ICE OUT FOR GOOD.

Participants walk silently, in the first lap of our SIGNS OF FASCISM MARCH, single file, through downtown — dressed in all black — each carrying a stark black-and-white sign naming one warning sign of authoritarianism in America today.

A slow heartbeat drum sets the pace. No chanting. No shouting. No confrontation.

The second lap, representing ICE OUT FOR GOOD, will emulate the first lap’s style and demeanor.

All signs are provided at the start of the march.

This is a peaceful, disciplined visibility action designed to make people pause, reflect, and see what is happening in our country.

Good Trouble Indivisible&apos;s

ICE OUT: Community Think-Tank is an open, inclusive space for community members to come together to talk, listen, and think critically about what is happening with ICE and immigration enforcement in our cities.

This gathering is not a protest or a lecture. It is a facilitated community conversation designed to:

	•	Share thoughts, concerns, and lived experiences

	•	Discuss the real impacts of ICE activity on families and communities

	•	Brainstorm ideas, actions, and solutions focused on getting ICE out of our cities

	•	Build understanding, solidarity, and community-driven strategies for change

While broader concerns about the current Trump administration and its policies may arise naturally, this Think-Tank will remain intentionally focused on ICE—its role, its impact, and what meaningful community resistance and alternatives can look like.

All are welcome. No prior knowledge or political affiliation is required.
Respectful dialogue and shared humanity are the foundation of this space.

Hosted by: Good Trouble Indivisible
Accessibility: Indoor, seated, warm, and community-centered

This a local Indivisible event!

*A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*</p>

<h3>ICE OUT: COMMUNITY VIGIL | Saugatuck</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Sunday, February 8, 2026 at 10:30 PM UTC - 11:30 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>All Saints Episcapol Church<br>252 Grand St<br>Saugatuck, MI 49453</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>ICE OUT COMMUNITY VIGIL – A Space for Witness, Grief, and Collective Voice

Host Organization:
Good Trouble Indivisible (with community partners)

📍All Saints Episcopal Church (Sanctuary – indoors)
     252 Grand St, Saugatuck, MI 49453

📆 Sunday, February 8, 2026 (and every Sunday evening thereafter)

⏰ 5:30 PM – 6:30 PM | Please allow additional time for a quiet, respectful departure by 7:00 PM.

Event Description:
This is a community-led ICE OUT vigil, held inside the sanctuary of All Saints Episcopal Church—created as a space for reflection, shared grief, witness, and collective care.

This gathering is non-partisan and open to all. People of all backgrounds, beliefs, and political affiliations are welcome. The focus of this vigil is humanitarian, moral, and grounded in shared human dignity.

There will be no featured speakers and no formal program. Instead, the vigil centers the voices of those who attend. Community members are invited—if they choose—to stand and speak from the pulpit or from their seats, sharing how they feel about ICE enforcement practices, including detention, deportation, family separation, brutality, and loss of life.

This is a space to:

	•	Speak names

	•	Speak truth

	•	Bear witness together

	•	Sit with one another in reflection and care

A light facilitation will help maintain a respectful, grounded flow, but the vigil itself belongs to the community.

What to Expect:

	•	Indoor, seated vigil

	•	Quiet, respectful atmosphere

	•	Community sharing (voluntary)

	•	No microphones or amplification

	•	No chanting or movement outside the sanctuary

What This Is / Is Not:

	✔ A vigil, ✖ not a protest

	✔ Non-partisan and community-centered

	✔ Open and welcoming to all

	✔ A space for moral witness and shared humanity

	✖ Not a rally or planning meeting

All are welcome who come in the spirit of respect, reflection, and care for one another.

<h3>ICE out for Good!  Civil Rights Sundays</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Sunday, February 1, 2026 at 8:00 PM UTC - 9:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Market Square<br>Portsmouth, NH 03801</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Last week, over 1,200 people came out to protest the Murder of Renee Good, with ICE out for Good! and all that is going on! The fascist takeover of our country. The disregard for our Constitution and our laws.
The Murder of Renee Good, despite the attempts to obfuscate, boils down to the fact that nothing she did deserved a death sentence, and ICE was acting as Judge, Jury, and Executioner. Not just Jonothan Ross, but we have seen similar disregard for the law across the country.
Venezuela is still going on, as is the immigration crackdown, and now we have to worry about Iran and attacking our NATO partner, Greenland.
✔ Oppose U.S. war/militarism
✔ Reject regime change and sovereignty violations
✔ Call for peace and respect for international law
Join us at 3! Civil Rights Sundays!
Say No to the military being used against Citizens!
Due Process is being denied to immigrants; it is only a matter of time before it is taken from citizens!

Join us today to save our Democracy!

Build a Democracy that Money Can&apos;t Buy!
Stand up for Democracy!
Stand up for Our Country!
Stand up for Immigrants!
Stand up for History!
Stand up for Equity!
Stand up for Working People!
and on and on and on....
The Hand&apos;s Off and NO KINGS Rallies were awesome but we need to continue!
We stand along the street in front of the North Church, On Congress Street! the Brick Church off of Market Square in Portsmouth!
Everyone is welcome to bring their own signs, We also have signs, banners, and flags to share.
We call the event Civil Rights Sundays, we started in November of 2016 after Trump won the first time, and we were in the square every Sunday until Covid shut us down, then we went back out when Ukraine was invaded and brought back the name Civil Rights Sundays when Roe Vs Wade was overturned.
Please join us at 3 PM!
Call for a continued ceasefire in Gaza and for an end to our administration using our tax dollars to support a holocaust!
*A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*</p>

<h3>Say Something! Do Something!</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 21, 2026 at 7:00 PM UTC - 9:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>International Servant Leaders Museum<br>9233 Shermer Rd<br>Morton Grove, IL 60053</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Niles Maine Township</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>On the birthday of John Lewis, we gather in the spirit of good trouble—the disciplined, nonviolent pursuit of justice rooted in conscience, service, and respect for the rule of law. Hosted by the International Servant Leaders Museum in association with  Indivisible Niles Maine Township,  this educational program reflects the core principles of servant leadership and a clear commitment to legal rights, constitutional protections, and lawful civic engagement.

The Reverend Dr. Michael Woolf will reflect on his civil rights protest experiences at the Broadview ICE facility, offering firsthand insight into faith-guided, nonviolent action that seeks accountability while honoring due process. This presentation will be followed by an informative presentation by Sanctuary Niles Township about how to protect our communities through local advocacy efforts, mutual aid and worker solidarity. The event will end with an opportunity for informal chats with the speakers, and representatives of several local Indivisible chapters.

Together, this program honors the legacy of John Lewis by translating moral courage into informed action—cultivating servant leaders who uphold human dignity, strengthen community trust, and work within the law to advance justice for all.</p>

<h3>Stop 287g, Abolish ICE! Lakeland, FL</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 28, 2026 at 10:00 PM UTC - 12:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Lakeside Village Mall<br>1479 Town Center Dr<br>Lakeland, FL 33803</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p># 🛑 Stop 287g ⛓️‍💥 Abolish ICE 🧊 Save the Everglades 🐊
*Hosted by DEFUND OLIGARCHY · BLESSED BY LIBERTY · INDIVISIBLE*
([en español](https://mobilize.us/s/skrhfa))

#### Non-Partisan Public Demonstration — Saturday, Jan 24, 2026
##### Lakeland, FL

For 01/24, we are meeting at 4:00 pm at the intersection, but we will be more on the side in front of Starbucks and Louis Papa&apos;s, but outside the mall, not inside the mall. Locally this is a small assembly, but we are in solidarity with many other groups throughout the nation demonstrating against Avelo, 287g agreements, and human rights abuses in small cities just like ours.

##### Read all instructions

We are taking a stand for ICE abolition and against the removal of individuals without due process — violating the core principles of our republic. 

This is a call to action. We’re joining forces to demand that Polk County end its involvement in unconstitutional detention policies.

# 🪧 Our Demands
✊ Polk County Government, it’s ICE or us.

You cannot serve both the people and an agency that tears families apart, starves humans, withholds water, denies medical care, kills people, forces humans into slavery, performs sterilizations without consent, and refuses to recognize U.S. birth certificates and REAL ID.

✊ Polk County residents: Boycott anyone profiting from ICE

✊ Polk County: End 287g agreement.

✊ DHS &amp; James Uthmeier: No Alligator Alley Concentration Camp. No cages on sacred ground. 🐊

✊ ICE: Stay out of Florida. Stop terrorizing schools, hospitals, courthouses, and workplaces. End detention. Process only violent offenders with criminal convictions.

✊ LPD &amp; PCSO: Do not cooperate with ICE. Arrest ICE agents operating without signed judicial warrants for violent criminal offenders.

✊ Sheriff Grady Judd: Stop collaborating with ICE until DHS reforms are complete. PSCO should not be helping send people to concentration camps.

✊Scott Franklin, Rick Scott, Ashley Moody: Defund &amp; abolish ICE. 

✊ Florida State Legislature: Ban the use of state taxpayer money for ICE operations. Pass legislation banning cooperation with ICE beyond what federal law requires.


# 🛑 WHY WE’RE PROTESTING

❌U.S. citizens and work permit holders — like Juan Carlos Lopez-Gomez and Heidy Sanchez Tejeda — have been detained without cause.

❌DHS &amp; ICE have unilaterally seized protected land in the Everglades to create a 5,000-person prison with no A/C and no access to lawyers by raiding FEMA and charging the state $450 million, despite the objections of county and tribal leadership. 

❌Children are being separated from parents, denied legal representation, and even deported during active custody disputes — like two-year-old citizen known as V.M.L.

❌Our Constitutional rights — due process, legal counsel, protection from executive overreach — are being ignored.

# ✨ WE STAND FOR:
- Families
- Immigration rights
- Due process
- Constitutional liberty for all
- Holding corporations accountable for profiting from human suffering

# 🗓️ EVENT DETAILS

📍 Lakeland, FL 

🕒 Saturday, Jan 24, 2025, 4 pm - 6 pm

🎨 Signs provided (but feel free to bring your own especially if it highlights the case of individuals who have been unlawfully detained or removed)

🎭 Costumes, instruments &amp; kids welcome

🌞 Dress for the weather &amp; wear sunscreen, sunglasses, and a mask for privacy

🚶‍♀️ Accessible sidewalks

📢 We will be singing and chanting

🚻 Nearby public restrooms available

🚗 Free parking 

# 💡 TIPS

👍We are committed to nonviolence and having a peaceful assembly. Stay respectful in all interactions.

👍Be alert: impersonators and fake news outlets posing as independent media may be present. Verify credentials before giving an interview.

👍Don’t engage with trolls or agitators. They may pretend to be a fellow protester. If they are really interested, you can point them towards the pamphlets and literature that we have. Remember we are fighting for everyone&apos;s rights, even the people that don&apos;t agree with us and the ones that are really annoying.

👍Focus your energy on building unity and protecting our democratic, constitutional republic.

# 🎶 SING FOR LIBERTY 
### We recommend brushing up on these songs if you like to sing along, but we alternate a lot with regular chanting and mini speeches, so no pressure to sing.

- [This Land is Your Land](https://youtu.be/2Q7PULELvok?si=2ZBVKeoM5Ker0Zad)

<h3>Whistle Kit/Senate Debate Watch Party - Elk Grove Village, Illinois</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Friday, February 20, 2026 at 12:30 AM UTC - 2:30 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Real Time Sports Bar &amp; Grill<br>1120 W Devon Ave<br>Elk Grove Village, IL 60007</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Elk Grove Township</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>**Join Indivisible Elk Grove Township in blowing the whistle on ICE!**

Whistle Kit making parties are a community safety practice rooted in resistance movements to help alert neighbors during immigration raids.

In moments like these, we’re reminded that protection is not just a policy, it’s a community responsibility.

Make new friends, watch the U.S. Senate debate, and discuss local and national issues, all while saving democracy by making Whistle Kits **TOGETHER**!

We will provide all you&apos;ll need, including zines, Know Your Rights cards, and whistle kit supplies! We ask that you take kits home with you to distribute to local business, neighbors, and anyone who is in this fight with us. Bring yourself, and perhaps a few friends! 

Real Time Sports Bar &amp; Grill is graciously allowing us to use their location, so  we ask that you please purchase food and beverages while you&apos;re here. Everyone will receive their own individual tab. Please tip your server!</p>

<h3>DEFEND THE VOTE:  Free, Fair &amp; Secure Elections Without Fear or Interference</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Wednesday, February 11, 2026 at 11:00 PM UTC - 1:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>First Parish Congregational Church<br>2 Church St<br>Gorham, ME 04038</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Cumberland County ME</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Trump has tried to strong-arm Minnesota--and many other states--into handing over their voter rolls, and in Georgia this week, Trump sent the FBI into Fulton County and seized ballots and election records from 2020, pulling evidence from a free and fair election to keep alive the lie that the election was stolen from him.

With ICE now terrorizing Maine, who knows what tricks the Trump regime will pull to subvert our election. While we successfully fended off a MAGA-driven effort to take away absentee voting in Maine last November, there are no guarantees that our voting rights and protections will be there when we go to the polls next November. 

Our democracy only works when every voter can participate freely—and every ballot is protected. Learn about Maine’s election process and constitutionally guaranteed voting rights, including ranked-choice voting and absentee voting. We will also dig into how misinformation and legal challenges can undermine local elections—and what we can do, as citizens, to defend free, fair, and secure elections going forward. The evening will address these two questions:

How do we ensure free, fair and secure elections in Maine’s 2026 midterm elections? 
What action or activities can we all take to ensure Maine&apos;s elections are free, fair and secure?

<h3>Signs of Solidarity Outreach #2 at Gurnee Mills</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 7, 2026 at 5:00 PM UTC - 7:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Gurnee Mills Mall - Rainforest Cafe Entrance<br>5688 Northridge Dr<br>Gurnee, IL 60031</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> NE Lake County IL Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>**Join NE Lake County Indivisible Outreach Team for our 2nd Signs of Solidarity Outreach at Gurnee Mills!**

Signs of Solidarity (SoS) is a national campaign encouraging businesses, construction sites and restaurants to post signs declaring that ICE is not welcome on the premises, and is prohibited from entering spaces designated as private or employees only. We will provide materials and training so you can have conversations with local managers and business owners about displaying signs, protecting immigrant workers, and their rights and responsibilities if ICE shows up at their workplace.

Through the winter months, we will plan outreach efforts indoors where possible - doing Know Your Rights canvassing apartment complexes, mall walking with SoS, and the occasional neighborhood walk on those balmy Midwestern 40 degree days when we can get them!

We will provide all training and supplies, and folks can stay as long as they are comfortable and able to stay buddied up. We ensure that canvassing is done in pairs for safety reasons.

Remember to dress for the weather, and wear your walking shoes!

This event is planned by the Outreach Team of NE Lake County Indivisible.

Why We’re Showing Up — February 16

The Trump Administration and MAGA threaten our families, our freedoms, and our democracy — and as a community - we stand together! 

• Civil rights protections are being rolled back
• LGBTQ+ and trans rights are under attack
• Federal funds are being used to punish communities
• Democratic norms and free elections are being undermined
• ICE and the National Guard are being weaponized against civilians - kidnapping citizens and destroying families 

We stand for democracy, dignity, and accountability.

IWLC will host a sign making night prior to the protest at the Lake Villa District Library (Munn Rd) 2/10 -6pm - 8:30

~There appears to be parking available in close proximity to the protest site ~</p>

<h3>Solidarity with Detained Immigrants</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Sunday, February 1, 2026 at 9:00 PM UTC - 10:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>14450 49th Street N<br>Clearwater, FL 33762</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>In cooperation with The Interfaith Alliance, we are hosting a weekly vigil/demonstration on 49th street by the Pinellas Courthouse Complex.

At least 30 people died in ICE “Detention” in 2025. Currently more than 59,000 immigrants are being held by ICE, separated from friends, family, and enduring inhumane conditions. Our government via ICE is perpetrating human right violations. We will not stand by while watching it happen. Please join us for this weekly action, in solidarity with the mothers, fathers, sons and daughters being held by ICE. We will not stop til the detention centers are closed and our immigrant friends are given due process and released.

*A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*</p>

<h3>NO KINGS 3</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, March 28, 2026 at 2:00 PM UTC - 4:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Seminole Boulevard &amp; West Bay Drive<br>Largo, FL 33771</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Mid-Pinellas</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>In 2025, millions of Americans came together in nonviolent protest to oppose the growing authoritarian actions of the Trump administration and affirm that this nation belongs to its people, not to kings. Since then, people have continued to rise up nonviolently against the Trump administration’s ongoing brutality and abuses of power, including the latest escalation in Minnesota. 

The No Kings Coalition is activating an immediate and ongoing nationwide digital organizing effort leading up to our next mass mobilization on March 28, including a flagship event in the Twin Cities.

But we want to say upfront: As we prepare for a massive mobilization months from now, we cannot lose sight of the work right in front of us -- in Congress, in our statehouses, and in our neighborhoods -- to rein in ICE and protect each other from this regime’s chaos, corruption, and violence. 

👉 That’s why the No Kings coalition will be leading regular ICE watch trainings throughout the winter. 

👉 That’s why we must continue to put pressure on Democrats to hold the line on reining in ICE and denying it a single additional penny in taxpayer funding.

👉 And that’s why we’ll likely be asking you to exercise your First Amendment rights through a number of mobilizations before the big one.</p>

<h3>Protest Home Depot</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 7, 2026 at 3:00 PM UTC - 5:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>On Seminole Boulevard in front of Largo Home Depot<br>10689 Ulmerton Rd<br>Largo, FL 33771</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>**Indivisible and Showing Up for Racial Justice (SURJ) are joining forces against Home Depot for allowing ICE to kidnap our neighbors on their properties.**

There are currently an estimated 59,000 people held in ICE detention centers. Join our protest of this inhumane situation  **Every Saturday from 10:00 to noon on the sidewalk along Seminole Blvd in front of the Home Depot at 10689 Ulmerton Rd.**

Let’s take this boycott campaign right to them until Home Depot publicly denounces ICE on their properties.

You can bring a letter saying you do not support Home Depot allowing ICE to use their property as a hunting ground for non-violent, law-abiding immigrants; and they’ll be hand delivered to the store manager.

So, join us from 10 a.m. to noon every Saturday at Ulmerton and Seminole Blvd or get some friends together and picket a Home Depot near you!

This a local Indivisible event!

<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Treetops Resort<br>3962 Wilkinson Rd<br>Gaylord, MI 49735</p>

<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Join us in Gaylord for a People’s Hearing bringing together community members, local leaders, and environmental experts from across Northern Michigan.

One year after the devastating March 2025 ice storms, families, farmers, and small business owners are still navigating a long road to recovery—from repairing property and rebuilding livelihoods to preparing for future extreme weather storms. 

This People’s Hearing creates space for Northern Michigan residents to share what they lived through and speak directly with elected officials about what their communities need moving forward.

The event is designed as a community gathering, with time to connect with neighbors, Michigan-based nonprofit organizations, and local leaders. Food and drinks will be available. Members of the press will be in attendance to help elevate community voices and stories beyond the room.</p>

<h3>No ICE No War</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Friday, May 1, 2026 at 4:00 PM UTC - 6:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Presque Isle County District Court<br>151 E Huron Ave<br>Rogers City, MI 49779</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> May Day Strong</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Trump is waging war and committing murder to enrich his billionaire backers. We are fighting to stop him. **Stand with us and take action this weekend to demand an end to the occupation of Venezuela and our cities.** 

We’re focusing on corporate targets - companies set to benefit most from the occupation of ICE or Venezuela. 

This week, our target is **Hilton Hotels**, housing this administration&apos;s ICE goons.

**We stand united demanding an end to the Venezuelan occupation and the removal of reckless untrained ICE agents from our communities.** And we&apos;re taking our fight to the companies that are backing this administration and benefiting most.

**Together we will hit these companies in their pocketbooks, force the administration to end the occupation of Venezuela and our cities and spread the word to our neighbors that we deserve better.**

Every dollar spent in wars overseas or at home is a dollar we paid for with our taxes - a dollar that could and should go to helping our communities thrive. We can have good jobs, better schools, access to healthcare and get our basic needs met. But not while our government works for billionaires and not for us.

Join us, stand strong and speak up.

*Please note: A core principle behind all our events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events*</p>

<h3>Open Letter to Sarasota County School Board</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Thursday, January 15, 2026 at 5:00 AM UTC - 5:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> SEE Alliance</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>**Sign the community’s open letter to the Sarasota County School Board: keep ICE out of Sarasota County Schools.**

This letter will be delivered publicly at the Tuesday, January 20 school board meeting as part of the official public record. Signing allows us to demonstrate clear community concern.

Signers of this letter will be invited to a community forum to receive clarity on what is and isn’t happening in Sarasota County Schools, including the limits of this resolution. Signers will also receive a shared messaging guide to support calm, factual, student-centered dialogue in emails, comments, and conversations.


**READ THE OPEN LETTER BELOW**

Dear Sarasota County School Board Members,

We, a coalition of students, parents, educators, community leaders, and concerned residents across Sarasota County and Florida, write with urgency and deep concern regarding the recent resolution introduced by the Board Chair  affirming “full cooperation” with law enforcement, including U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). 

This resolution, while not altering formal district policy, imports national fears into our local schools. It confounds civil immigration matters with criminal activity and creates the perception that schools are extensions of enforcement rather than spaces for learning. This undermines the trust essential for student success and has already begun to sow unnecessary fear among families at a time when immigrant communities nationwide are facing escalating threats.

In the wake of national discussions around mass deportations, expanded surveillance, and normalized dehumanizing anti-immigrant rhetoric, school leaders have a responsibility to protect stability for all students. Sarasota schools have long been pillars of trust and education in our community. This resolution does not address a local crisis; ICE is not currently operating on Sarasota school campuses, there is no routine enforcement, and our schools already comply with valid warrants and legal requirements. This resolution does not change policy or practice. Its impact is cultural, contributing to  fear and confusion that harms all students and families.

The concerns raised by this resolution are well supported. Research, lived experiences, and expert insights from educators and mental health professionals show that such enforcement-oriented language in school contexts causes real damage:

- Fear alone increases absenteeism and chronic absenteeism, as families disengage from schools to avoid perceived risk. This has occurred in school districts across Florida.
- Fear reduces academic performance and classroom engagement, with students experiencing heightened anxiety, stress, and mental health strain.
- Fear erodes trust between families and educators, discouraging communication with teachers, counselors, and nurses, which is essential to student well-being.
- Immigration violations are largely civil matters, not criminal offenses. Language in this resolution that conflates the two creates confusion about existing district policies and undermines public understanding of how schools actually operate..
- In a national context of heightened enforcement and surveillance, vague language creates confusion by conflicting with established procedures, which Sarasota schools will continue to follow. 

This resolution distracts from real educational needs in Sarasota schools, prioritizing political posturing over student-centered leadership.

Schools work when families trust them. Resolutions do not need to change policy to cause harm. The fear they generate alone is enough to keep students out of classrooms and undermine learning. Our schools should be places of stability in national moments of uncertainty, not sources of fear.

Board members, we urge you to use your authority to reject this resolution and prevent it from advancing. Doing so would reaffirm a commitment to keeping Sarasota schools focused on education, safety, and success for all students. Specifically, we ask the Board to:

1. Publicly affirm that Sarasota County Schools and grounds will continue to operate under existing district policy and established procedures, including compliance with the law as required, and that schools are not, and will not be used for, routine immigration enforcement activity.
2. Vote against, or withdraw, the resolution affirming “full cooperation” with ICE, which does not change policy but risks mischaracterizing the role of schools and creating unnecessary fear within Sarasota County Schools. 
3. Recommit to student privacy, safety, and equitable access to education for all students, regardless of immigration status.
4. Engage the community through a public forum where families, students, and educators can ask questions, receive clear information about district policy and practice, and discuss school operations without fear.

This letter will be delivered publicly at the Tuesday, January 20 school board meeting as part of the official public record. Signers of this letter will be invited to a community forum to learn more about the situation, receive a clear explanation of what is happening and what is not, and access a shared messaging guide to support calm, factual, student-centered engagement.

By taking the steps outlined above, the Board can help restore clarity, trust, and stability in our schools. Our strong schools depend on students showing up, families feeling secure, and educators being able to do their jobs without fear disrupting the classroom. Actions taken by the school board should strengthen this foundation.

We urge our elected school board members to lead with responsibility, and a commitment to keeping schools focused on what they exist to do: educate, support, and protect students.

Signed, 


Students, parents, educators, and community members</p>

<h3>Resist Fascism &amp; Save Our Democracy - 44th Weekly Sarasota Rally</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, February 3, 2026 at 2:00 PM UTC - 4:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>2001 Siesta Dr<br>Sarasota, FL 34239</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Join us for our 44th weekly rally in Sarasota to resist fascism, get ICE off our streets, and support Social Security. Keep the pressure on! Meet friendly, like-minded people who are standing up for our rights. Help save the Social Security we paid for and our families are paying for.

------------------------------------------------
* No Trump “ICE GOONS” in SARASOTA Schools!
* No concentration camps!
* No kidnapping of innocent people!
------------------------------------------------

This is a local, Sarasota-based, grassroots rally by Indivisible Sarasota.

WE ARE SEEN BY 2,500-3,000 VEHICLES EACH WEEK!

We meet outside the Social Security office, at the intersection of Siesta Drive and South Tamiami Trail. (see map)  The big sign there is for the restaurant, Flemings.

The rally is in the shade and during morning rush hour, so it will be relatively cool when the weather is hot, but with a lot of visibility.

Parking is right across Siesta Drive in the empty shopping mall parking lot.
By persisting week after week, we are showing the people of Sarasota that we are in this for the long term and will persevere as long as necessary.
Expect lots of supportive honking of horns.

Bring your own sign about ICE, Social Security or any other topic related to the resistance against the MAGA attack on our democracy.
See you there!</p>

<h3>PALM BEACH INDIVISIBLES (PBC): &quot;NO KINGS&quot;</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, March 28, 2026 at 3:00 PM UTC - 5:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Target - Palm Beach Lakes, Blvd. WPB<br>1760 Palm Beach Lakes Blvd<br>West Palm Beach, FL 33401</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Palm Beach Indivisibles</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>NO KINGS - NO THRONES - NO CROWNS


Palm Beach Indivisibles is organizing another powerful Palm Beach County “NO KINGS” protest on Saturday, March 28, 2026, from 11:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. The moment is now, and the stakes could not be higher.

Our last NO KINGS action brought nearly 4,000 people to the front lines of one of the most heavily traveled corridors in the county, commanding the attention of thousands of residents and U.S. and international visitors alike. This time, we’re going even bigger.

Crowds of 6,000 or more are expected to flood the streets in a united stand to Fight Fascism, Defend Democracy, and demand a country that works for all of us—not just the billionaire class. We will raise our voices against ICE abuses, the crushing cost of living, and the rise of millionaire and billionaire oligarchs who believe power belongs to them alone.

This is not a spectator moment. History is written by those who show up. Bring your signs. Bring your neighbors. Bring your outrage and your hope. If you’ve ever said, “enough is enough,” this is where you turn words into action.

No kings. No oligarchs. No silence.
March with us. Show up. Be counted.</p>

<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Leland Township Library<br>203 Cedar St<br>Leland, MI 49654</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Leelanau Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Want to feel like you are making a difference?  Join us and work on knitting or crocheting a Resist hat and/or write postcards. And if you already have a project in mind that you want to work on, feel free to bring that instead.  We are flexible!

I will have postcards and 200 stamps to send out to Congress and the White House.  Thanks to Leelanau Indivisible for purchasing the stamps.

We will also make Resist hats using fingering, DK, or worsted weight yarn.  They are based on the 1940’s hat Norwegians made and wore as a form of visual protest against Nazi occupation of their country. Within two years, the Nazis made these protest hats illegal and punishable by law to wear, make, or distribute.   The hats are red and have a tassel.

Patterns we are using:

Feel free to see what I am knitting.  https://www.ravelry.com/projects/kmd52/melt-the-ice-hat

<h3>Students Rise Up: FAU School Walkout to get ICE off Campus and Defend our Education</h3>

<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>FAU - Kenneth R. Williams Administration Building<br><br>Boca Raton, FL 33431</p>

<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>*Students Rise Up* is a plan to organize millions of students to disrupt business as usual and force our schools and our politicians to work for us.

Right now, billionaires and fascists are attacking our schools because they know that student protest could bring them down. Our power is that we outnumber them. If working people and students unite to use our power of disruption and non-cooperation, we can crack the foundations of their power.

On *February 25*, join the campus community in a school walkout to the lawn of the *Kenneth R. Williams Administration Building* next to the *Breezeway*.</p>

<h3>Joyful Resistance Coral Springs #NoICENoWar</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Friday, May 1, 2026 at 8:30 PM UTC - 10:30 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>University Drive in front of the Northwest Regional Library<br>3151 N University Dr<br>Coral Springs, FL 33065</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> May Day Strong</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Trump is waging war and committing murder to enrich his billionaire backers. We are fighting to stop him. **Stand with us and take action this weekend to demand an end to the occupation of Venezuela and our cities.** 

We’re focusing on corporate targets - companies set to benefit most from the occupation of ICE or Venezuela. 

This week, our target is **Hilton Hotels**, housing this administration&apos;s ICE goons.

**We stand united demanding an end to the Venezuelan occupation and the removal of reckless untrained ICE agents from our communities.** And we&apos;re taking our fight to the companies that are backing this administration and benefiting most.

**Together we will hit these companies in their pocketbooks, force the administration to end the occupation of Venezuela and our cities and spread the word to our neighbors that we deserve better.**

Every dollar spent in wars overseas or at home is a dollar we paid for with our taxes - a dollar that could and should go to helping our communities thrive. We can have good jobs, better schools, access to healthcare and get our basic needs met. But not while our government works for billionaires and not for us.

Join us, stand strong and speak up.

*Please note: A core principle behind all our events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events*</p>

<h3>F.A.F.O March - Forever Against Fascist Oppression March - Indivisible Wilton Manors</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 21, 2026 at 5:00 PM UTC - 8:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Corner of US1 &amp; E<br>5000 N Federal Hwy<br>Fort Lauderdale, FL 33308</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>This is a local Indivisible Wilton Manors event.

The F.A.F.O March, Forever Against Fascist Oppression March.

Join us as we march from Fort Lauderdale, over the bridge, in to Lauderdale By The Sea (LBTS), to protest there against this administration and their current actions in our country against it&apos;s own people.
We the people RESIST &amp; REJECT all forms of authoritarian and fascist regimes!
Stand with us, march with us, walk with us. EVERYONE is needed! Join us wherever you can join us from, if the walk is too long meet us enroute.

Why Lauderdale By The Sea?
Because they have sided with the corrupt, wannabe dictator, and are renaming a street after him! They do not care about anyone in our community and have demonstrated this by allowing their elected officials to dictate that the street will be renamed after the convicted Felon. Even after We The People stood up, spoke out and voted in majority against the renaming of one of OUR STREETS after a sexual abuser and friend of abusers.
We do NOT support nor enable this administration nor their violent terroristic government funded ICE agents nor their delusional, weak, cowardly leader. We do not support business&apos; that support them either!
While not all of LBTS stands by this attack on our community, our families, our friends, our loved ones, MANY DO!!!!
WE RESIST! WE SAY NO TO ALL FORMS OF OPPRESSION!
We are WE THE PEOPLE and WE SAY FUCK ALL FASCISTS!
F.A.F.O FOREVER AGAINST FASCIST OPPRESSION!

<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>4346 Commercial Ave<br>Madison, WI 53714</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> WisDems</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Meet us on Madison&apos;s East Side to Protest the Trump Administration.

This administration has deployed their secret police to our streets to abduct our neighbors and drive fear into the populace. We will not stand for ICE terrorizing our communities and murdering protesters. We demand an end to the terror and justice for all harmed. 

Trump&apos;s assault on Venezuela is an extreme abuse of power that cannot be tolerated. His actions could destabilize South America and cause widespread immiseration in the Western Hemisphere. How dare he do this in our name! We say, No! NO ICE! No war for oil! No to colonialism! We demand Peace among nations, peace in our communities, and the restoration of sanity.

Meet us on the pedestrian bridge over Hwy 30 that connects Commercial Avenue to North Thompson Drive. This is a non-violent protest. Bring your big signs and flags.</p>

<h3>Collier Know Your Rights &amp; Neighborhood Safety</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 21, 2026 at 5:00 PM UTC - 7:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Cornerstone United Methodist<br>8200 Immokalee Rd<br>Naples, FL 34119</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>This is a **Indivisible Gambit SWFL** event!
Indivisible Gambit SWFL, in collaboration with the **ACLU of Florida, Florida Immigration Coalition, Unidos Immokalee, and Voices of Bonita**, is taking action — and we invite you to join us.

Across our communities, many people are *feeling anxious, uncertain, and afraid.* That reaction **is normal.** Fear is often the goal of authoritarian systems: to isolate us, silence us, and make us feel powerless. But **courage is a choice** and choosing courage together is how we protect one another and how we win.

We invite you to join us

 **Saturday, February 21, 2026, 12:00–2:00 PM** for a Community Education and Organizing event at:

**Cornerstone United Methodist Church**
8200 Immokalee Road
Naples, FL 34119-9718

This gathering is designed to expand our outreach and strengthen local support networks by sharing practical, life-saving information and building community capacity.

At this event, participants will:

* Learn practical ways to stay safe and understand their rights
* Recognize and respond to concerning ICE activity
* Learn how volunteer legal observers educate community members and document encounters
* Get involved in rapid response, neighborhood watch efforts, and mutual aid
* Discover ways to support at-risk migrant families with basic needs

We are also actively recruiting and training:

* Volunteer legal observers
* Rapid responders
* Neighborhood watch volunteers
* Community members willing to assist with mutual aid

No one should face these moments alone. When we show up for each other informed, organized, and courageous we build real safety and real power.

We hope you’ll join us, bring a friend, and be part of this growing network of care, courage, and community defense.

*A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*</p>

<h3>KNIT-IN &amp; CROCHET ICE AWAY</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Thursday, February 5, 2026 at 12:30 AM UTC - 2:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Democratic party of Outagamie County<br>516 W College Ave<br>Appleton, WI 54911</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> WisDems</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Join fellow crafters to knit your own MELT THE ICE HAT, or knit one for someone else.
You will need to purchase the pattern in advance. One site is Ravelry. Cost is $5. We cannot make copies of the pattern for distribution per copyright laws.
Check the pattern for materials to bring with you: red yarn, needles, markers, and a bit of chocolate. Ok, that’s not in the pattern, but it’s a good idea!
The history behind this pattern is: In the 1940s, Norwegians made and wore RED pointed hats with a tassel as a form of visual protest against the Nazi occupation of their country. Within two years, the Nazis made these protest hats illegal and punishable by law to wear, make, or distribute. It is time to revisit this design.
Hope you can join us. KNIT ON!!!</p>

<h3>NO ICE NO FEAR</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 21, 2026 at 3:00 PM UTC - 5:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Collier County Courthouse<br>3315 Tamiami Trl E<br>Naples, FL 34112</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>NO ICE NO FEAR is rally that refuses silence, submission and intimidation. We gather to confront a system that terrorizes families, shatters communities and rules through FEAR - to say, loudly and together, that we will not accept it.

A government that KIDNAPS, CAGES and KILLS peaceful people is not a democracy - it is a dictatorship. This rally is a call to abolish cruelty masquerading as law enforcement, to end raids &amp; deportations, and to defend the dignity &amp; humanity of immigrants without compromise.

We stand visible, unafraid and unapologetic:  Our communities will not be policed by fear and justice will not wait

<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>American Patriots in Minneapolis showed the nation what dedicated peaceful protesters can do. Despite the very present danger of ICE violence &amp; killings these American Heroes forced Trump to Back Down on the ICE Occupation of their city and got ICE Gruppenfuhrer Bovino removed from his command.  This is only a pause as the Trump Regime will come up with more Extremist Authoritarian actions to weaken our Democracy.  A coalition of pro-Democracy groups is stepping up together to carry out another far larger NO KINGS Day of rallies &amp; resistance to Dictatorship.  We need all those who care about the future of our nation &amp; its Democracy to join the millions of others that will be participating in this impactful event nationwide event.

Do not park in the CBP parking lot. Park next door at a restaurant-or other parking.  Non immigrants have a moral duty to do what we can to shine a light on the illegal actions of our government. This is one way we can do it. Sign up so we can grow our protests and stop the illegal abduction of immigrants who came here lawfully and are now being violently kidnapped and detained in Alligator Alcatraz or similar. Denied basic rights lawful immigrants are transported to countries they have never lived in and are often tortured.</p>

<h3>ICE OUT for GOOD - Bridge Brigade Visibility Action</h3>

<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Overpass adjacent to Lucy Winton Bell Fields<br>15601 Hudson Rd N<br>Lake Saint Croix Beach, MN 55043</p>

<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>About this event:

Wednesday, January 7th, a fellow Minnesotan was killed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Minneapolis, Minnesota. This killing is part of a broader pattern of unchecked violence, impunity, and abuse carried out by federal immigration enforcement agencies against members of our communities.

A broad coalition of groups across the country is calling for a coordinated Ice Out For Good Weekend of Action on Saturday, January 10th and Sunday, January 11th to demand accountability, honor the life lost, and make visible the human cost of ICE’s actions.

We are all Renee.

A core principle behind all ICE Out For Good events is a commitment to nonviolent action and no civil disobedience. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values, and to act lawfully at these events. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events. All events should be held in public spaces or on public property.

<h3>#IceOUT Campaign National Organizing Call</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Thursday, February 5, 2026 at 5:00 PM UTC - 6:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> ResistTrump Campaign</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has become a pillar of fear, surveillance, and authoritarian control. Communities across the U.S. are pushing back through lawful, nonviolent protest to expose ICE’s abuses and resist its presence in our neighborhoods.

Every week, the ResistTrump Campaign (www.resisttrump.us) will convene organizers and activists on this national call to plan actions, share resources, and strengthen the movement to drive ICE out of our cities.

On this call, you’ll be able to connect with others who are:

- Leading or joining local ICE protest campaigns

- Learning effective, nonviolent tactics for resisting ICE facilities and operations

- Building solidarity with immigrant communities

- Coordinating creative actions that highlight ICE as a pillar of the Trump regime

This is your place to learn, collaborate, and take bold, lawful action. Together, we can resist ICE and weaken the authoritarian system it supports.</p>

<h3>Minnesota families: caucus to get ICE out of schools!</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Wednesday, March 4, 2026 at 12:30 AM UTC - 2:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> TakeAction Minnesota</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Elections f**king matter, and everyday people like us have a powerful role to play in determining which candidates get a huge leg up in their race. From school board members to elected prosecutors to the governor, we deserve politicians who actually act to get ICE out of our schools, and who deliver the housing for all, food support, universal pre-K, and universal health care -- and more! -- that our families and communities deserve. 

We&apos;re getting trained in how to get politicians to deliver.

At this training you&apos;ll learn and practice how to show up where your voice has outsize power: precinct caucuses. (&quot;Precinct caucus&quot; is a gatekeeping phrase that means &quot;neighborhood meeting.&quot; These meetings happen all over Minnesota the evening of Feb 3, 2026.) 

The decisions everyday people make at this meeting determine which candidates get &quot;endorsed&quot; by a political party -- and get all all the votes, resources, and support that come with an endorsement. 

We&apos;ll learn what precinct caucus is, why it matters, and how we can show up to make sure that only #FamiliesOverBillionaires and #ICEout candidates get what they need to run competitive races.</p>

<h3>ICE OUT OF MN - Golden Valley/Crystal Bridge Brigade</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Sunday, February 1, 2026 at 6:00 PM UTC - 8:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Hwy 100 Pedestrian Bridge<br>2450 Lilac Dr N<br>Golden Valley, MN 55422</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>On Wednesday, January 7th, an American citizen, Renee Nicole Good, was killed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Minneapolis, Minnesota. On Saturday, January 24th, another American citizen, Alex Pretti was tackled and killed by multiple ICE agents in Minneapolis. This killing is part of a broader pattern of unchecked violence and abuse carried out by federal immigration enforcement agencies against members of our communities.

Since then, ICE has only escalated in abducting, harassing, and terrorizing our immigrant friends, family, and neighbors throughout MN. They break laws without abandon. They violate our constitutional rights. And we need to continue to speak out and raise awareness of their atrocities.

This event is to continue to build solidarity in resistance to ICE&apos;s actions, and connect community members with resources to help us through this invasion. Join us in telling ICE to leave MN for Good!

We will gather at the pedestrian bridge over Highway 100 in Golden Valley with our protest signs in a show of solidarity and resistance against the current ICE occupation of our state. This is to increase visibility and awareness that we want ICE OUT of MN.

A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.</p>

<h3>Human Cost of ICE: A Memorial Protest and Banner Drop</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Sunday, February 8, 2026 at 5:00 PM UTC - 7:30 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>1422 N Loop 336 W<br>Conroe, TX 77304</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>This a local Indivisible event!
We are protesting because people are dying as a result of ICE enforcement and related policing, including deaths in ICE custody, deaths during enforcement actions, and innocent American citizens killed during law enforcement responses connected to immigration operations and protest activity.
These deaths are documented and preventable. No one involved was sentenced to death.
Participants are asked to bring a tombstone shaped sign with the name of a person who died in ICE custody, during enforcement, or during related policing actions. Each tombstone represents a real human life lost. Please dress in all black if you are able to. We will also have a banner drop on the 1-45 overpass where the protest will be taking place.
This is a peaceful demonstration demanding accountability, transparency, and respect for human life. 
There is nearby parking at 1422 N Loop 336 W, Conroe, TX. 77304. Please do not park in the Starbucks parking lot as your car will be towed.
We will be collecting non-perishable food items to benefit the local food bank Abundant Harvest.

<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Conference Room, Roger Maris Hallway, West Acres Mall<br>3902 13th Ave S<br>Fargo, ND 58103</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Cass County Dems United</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Protect what you love!

What are your rights when you protest? What can law enforcement, Border Patrol, or ICE legally ask or demand of you? And how can you protect yourself and others in moments when it matters most?
Join local advocates for an empowering, practical presentation on constitutionally protected rights related to protesting and interacting with law enforcement, Border Patrol, and ICE. This event is designed to give everyday people clear, accurate information so we can show up informed, confident, and prepared.

You’ll learn:
-What the Constitution protects when you protest or gather in public
-Your rights (and limits) when interacting with police, Border Patrol, or ICE
-The Dos and Don&apos;ts if approached or questioned
-How to look out for yourself and your community while minimizing risk

Whether you’re a seasoned organizer, a first‑time protester, or simply want to understand your rights, this space is for you. No legal background required, just a desire to be informed and ready.
Knowledge is power. Come learn your rights and help build safer, stronger community.</p>

Help show Cedar Park how many of us work to end GOP fascism and corruption -- ICE OUT! No War! No Kings &amp; No Dictators, End GOP Corruption, Fund the ACA, and more.

Bring handheld signs for the bridge traffic. Our collection of banners overlooking the highway is growing fast!

Join us 3-5 pm for our peaceful banner and popup event, each January Monday afternoon.

While the large banners overlook the 183A tollway, several of us will proudly display signs facing traffic on E Park. 

Parking is easy, the bridge is &quot;protestor friendly.&quot; Only drawback is that no public rest room is available, so be prepared for that!

Hope to see you Monday!</p>

<h3>Dems and Friends Thursday Ice House Crawl</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Friday, February 13, 2026 at 12:00 AM UTC - 2:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Bombay Bicycle Club<br>3506 N St Mary&apos;s St<br>San Antonio, TX 78212</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Bexar County Democrats</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Every Thursday, 6-8 PM, we go to a different place with a laid back vibe just to schmooze and find out who&apos;s who. We also discover ice houses and other neighborhood watering holes that tell us a story about San Antonio history and culture.

Now more than ever we need to get together and visualize how we are going to build a rock solid team to Get Out the Vote in 2026. We think the best way to start is by having fun. A laid back vibe and good beer, interesting casual conversation, some good food, and VOILA! Fun and friends! 

The Crawls and the Dems are going to be bigger, better and bolder right here, right now. So we&apos;re looking for new friends to join the old. Bring someone with you, meet someone new as well as getting together with old friends for a good mix and mingle. If you&apos;re curious about what Democrats are about, this is a good way to learn about them in a natural habitat.

This is a low expectation event--no hard start or stop time--come and go when you feel like it--no sitting in one spot, no listening to speakers, no pressure to volunteer, not even talking about politics unless you want to.  All you have to do is say hi to someone you don&apos;t know and be nice.</p>

Sidewalk Protest

Back by popular demand after the Parker Protest, Speak Now is asking our community to come together and speak out against ICE and the fascist regime. Bring your signs and stand in solidarity with us to show Douglas County that we will not be silenced by the regime&apos;s terror tactics. We stand in defense of our constitutional rights, and against government sanctioned murder. We refuse to allow history to repeat itself on our watch. 

This will be a recurring event, weather permitting.

<h3>Signs of Solidarity-Feb. 15 at Florida &amp; Dahlia-Business KYR Training/Canvass</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Sunday, February 15, 2026 at 8:00 PM UTC - 10:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Virginia Village Library<br>1500 S Dahlia St<br>Denver, CO 80222</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Denver Action</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Our hearts are broken by the events in Minneapolis.  We are upset with the unlawful actions of federal agents there.  We will not sit idly by and wait for that chaos to be visited on the Denver area.

Join us to be trained to canvass local businesses and to share with them Know Your Rights information to help them protect themselves and their employees in case of a raid by ICE. We share with them the importance of making a plan, training employees and creating safe spaces, and we suggest what employees should or should not do. We tell them how to report wrong doing by ICE and CBP.  At the end attendees will have the opportunity to canvass local businesses.

Canvassing is a demonstration of our solidarity with all of our Denver community and has been received warmly by the businesses visited.</p>

<h3>Love Not Fear: Stop Palantir - Valentine’s Day Sidewalk Action</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 14, 2026 at 7:00 PM UTC - 9:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Cherry Creek North<br>2nd and Detroit<br>Denver, CO 80206</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Denver Action</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>This Valentine’s Day, we’re choosing love over fear.

Palantir’s multi-million-dollar contracts with ICE power surveillance and data platforms that drive detention, deportation, workplace raids, and family separation. These technologies spread fear through our neighborhoods and harm immigrant communities.

Join us for a peaceful sidewalk action outside Palantir headquarters to say clearly: Do not work with ICE – Cancel all contracts.

Bring your heart, your voice, and your commitment to justice. Signs and chants welcome. 

A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.</p>

<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> SoBoCo Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>In 2025, ICE paid BI Incorporated over $171.5 million for their electronic monitoring or “e-carceration” tools. That includes a secretive $1.6 million
contract for a bounty hunter-like service called “skip tracing”, where BI Incorporated tracks the locations of immigrants in their communities for ICE ERO. They are currently owned by GEO which is a private prison company that runs the Aurora Concentration Camp for detainees.

Join us outside BI&apos;s Boulder County offices to let them know we do not want businesses here that support ICE! We demand BI drop those contracts!!!</p>

<h3>Pinal County Board of Sup. Meeting</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Wednesday, February 4, 2026 at 4:30 PM UTC - 8:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>135 N Pinal St<br>Florence, AZ 85132</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Queen Creek San Tan Valley Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Once again, Brad Miller, Pinal County Attorney, has expressed his determination to enter an agreement with ICE under a Task Force Enforcement MOU.  The county board of supervisors consulted their attorneys twice, and on January 21st, they publicly heard from their attorney, who stated unequivocally that the county does not have the legal authority to enter a law enforcement agreement with ICE.  They voted to continue the MOU for the Jail Enforcement Model that has been in place for at least 5 years.  We have a copy of the MOU from March 2020, but Sheriff Teeple, who was unclear about the dates, said that there was one in place earlier as well.  Either way, the Jail Enforcement Model is much more limited, allowing deputies to turn over a criminal upon their release from jail if they are &quot;removable&quot;.  

The Task Force Model is the one we began seeing on our streets beginning in August.  This model seemed to use PCSO to pull over people of color, take their time to give a ticket while they waited for ICE, then monitor the situation, assist, and protect ICE during the abduction.  We have not seen this type of law enforcement stop since the county began consulting attorneys on the matter.  With ICE descending upon our state as I type, we do not want Brad Miller to unleash the Task Force Model on our neighborhoods again.  During the time he was illegally cooperating with ICE from August through January, I personally saw 3 stops in and near my neighborhood.  They were agressive and one of the people detained was an American.

        <description><![CDATA[
<h3>Rally with AJDems ICE OUT FOR GOOD</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 7, 2026 at 3:00 PM UTC - 6:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Apache Juction Marker<br>South Phelps Drive &amp; East Old West Highway<br>Apache Junction, AZ 85119</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Pinal County Democratic Party</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>The Ice Out for Good Rally is not a quiet gathering — it’s a surge of collective power. This is where people who are tired of being ignored, dismissed, or frozen out of the political process come together to melt the old barriers and ignite something new. The rally channels frustration into purpose, turning cold discontent into blazing determination. Voices rise, energy builds, and the message is unmistakable: communities are done waiting for change. They’re ready to demand it.

This event is a rallying cry for everyone who refuses to sit on the sidelines. It’s a space for bold ideas, unapologetic passion, and the kind of unity that shakes the ground beneath complacency. Attendees will connect with organizers who are pushing for fairness, accountability, and a political future shaped by people — not by apathy or inertia. Ice Out for Good is about breaking through the freeze, lighting a fire under civic engagement, and pushing forward with unstoppable momentum. This is the moment to stand up, speak out, and fuel a movement that refuses to cool down.

Meet at our usual corner of Phelps and Old West Hwy. in Apache Junction from 8am-11am. Please stay hydrated and bring water. :-) PLEASE PARK IN THE DIRT LOT ON THE NORTHEAST CORNER OF PHELPS AND OLD WEST HWY.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
<h3>Stop the Wars &amp; ICE Raids, Recuse Biggs, &amp; Show Us the Files</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Wednesday, February 11, 2026 at 10:00 PM UTC - 12:30 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>East Southern Avenue &amp; Power Road<br>Mesa, AZ 85206</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Mesa Valley Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>## ⚖️ Stop the Wars, Stop the Raids, Recuse Biggs, &amp; Show Us the Files

The opening weeks of 2026 have been defined by a sudden and aggressive shift in executive policy, marked by the military capture of Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela and a deadly surge in domestic ICE operations. Political analysts, congressional critics, and [Mesa Valley Indivisible](https://www.mesavalleyindivisible.org/) argue that these actions are not independent strategies, but rather a **governance by distraction** tactic intended to divert public attention from the Department of Justice’s stalling on the Epstein Files Transparency Act.

This standoff has intensified following the release of the explosive allegations by Sascha (Sasha) Riley, which names several high-profile figures, including **Representative Andy Biggs (R-AZ)** who is a key member of the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability. **Rep. Biggs** alleged connection to the files creates a profound conflict of interest, casting doubt on whether the Oversight Committee can impartially investigate a network that may implicate its own members.

📢 **Join [Mesa Valley Indivisible](https://www.mesavalleyindivisible.org/) **AGAIN** on Wednesday, February 11th in protesting against the distractionary wars in Venezuela &amp; the ICE raids across America while also demanding the release of the unredacted Epstein Files and recusal of Representative Andy Biggs!**


### 🆘Key Concerns Driving the Protest:

- **The Illegal War in Venezuela:** Just as the heat on the Epstein files reached a breaking point, the administration launched Operation Absolute Resolve. What is being sold as a &quot;strategic task&quot; is an illegal war for regime change and oil. They are trading the lives of soldiers and Venezuelans to create a decisive headline that buries their criminal scandals at home.

- **The Invasion of Our Neighborhoods:** The 120% surge in ICE manpower is not about safety; it is about keeping Americans in a permanent state of crisis. By flooding our streets with 12,000 new agents and conducting high-visibility raids, the administration is trying to keep the public focused on a manufactured domestic emergency so we stop asking who is on the Epstein list.

- **Release the Epstein Files**: We demand the immediate, unredacted public release of all federal files, client lists, and documents related to Jeffrey Epstein. We reject the notion that privacy can be used as a shield to protect powerful perpetrators and co-conspirators.

- **The Andy Biggs &amp; Sascha Riley Cover-Up:** We demand answers regarding the testimony of Sascha Riley. While Representative Andy Biggs poses as a champion of fact-driven transparency on the Oversight Committee, Riley’s claims suggest a much darker connection. You cannot oversee an investigation into your own associates. We demand an immediate, independent inquiry into these allegations.

### 🚩Our Demands:

**1. The Full, Unredacted Epstein Files:** Release all 5.2 million pages of the Epstein files immediately.

**2. An End to the War for Oil:** Withdraw troops from Venezuela and cease the regime change narrative.

**3. The Removal of Surge Forces:** End the ICE neighborhood invasions and return to the rule of law.

**4. The Investigation of Andy Biggs:** A public hearing on the Sascha Riley allegations. No more protection for the Oversight Committee.


### 🚨Important! 
Before the protest, please make sure to contact our governments offices and tell them your demands by [clicking this link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oDkJ3MY1nNap_fhzK8K8pTSWYg53Vsk9hBXcN0LkER0/edit?usp=sharing) – you will be provided with the contact phone numbers, email, addresses, websites, etc. and scripts for each. 


### 🪧Signs &amp; Messaging
Ideas for signs include: 
✅ Where are the Files?
✅ Abolish ICE. Release Files. Lose Biggs
✅ Release the Epstein Files
✅ Believe Sascha Riley

        <description><![CDATA[
<h3>Join Mesa Valley Indivisible to Protest ICE Deportations &amp; the AROCC Detention Center</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 21, 2026 at 4:00 PM UTC - 7:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>South Gilbert Road &amp; East Broadway Road<br>Mesa, AZ 85204</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Mesa Valley Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>## 🛫 ICE &amp; AROCC: Stop ICE operations at Mesa Gateway Airport!

For the past eight months, [Mesa Valley Indivisible](https://www.mesavalleyindivisible.org/) members and a coalition of groups around the country have been working relentlessly to end Avelo Airlines’ involvement in the unlawful and inhumane deportation of primarily non‑violent immigrants via Mesa Gateway Airport. 

Americans dedicated to ending Avelo&apos;s contract with ICE boycotted, protested, emailed and called our representatives/senators, held weekly meetings, etc. and on January 7, 2026, news broke that Avelo Airlines announced they were ending their ICE deportation flights!!

As we all celebrate this **HUGE WIN**, we also know ICE deportation flights are still occurring at the Mesa Gateway Airport &amp; the AROCC detention center remains active on the grounds. We can happily check off Avelo Airlines now, but it is time to move on to the next challenge which is ending ICE deportation flights &amp; closing the AROCC at our Mesa Gateway Airport! 

## 📢Join us on Saturday, February 21st, to challenge the use of the local airport for what are illegal, inhumane, and unconstitutional removal operations.

### 🆘Key Concerns Driving the Protest:

- **Corporate Complicity in Inhumane Practices**: These deportations are driven by profit and political patronage. Private contractors run detention and flight operations through non‑commercial hubs, creating durable infrastructure that outlasts elections. The incentive loop is clear: **more arrests → more funding → more capacity → more bodies.**


- **Conditions on the Ground**: Individuals slated for deportation or transfer are held in a secluded facility at the Mesa airport—near where commercial travelers dine—where they are reportedly kept without access to basic amenities like beds or showers until their flight.


- **Inhumane Treatment on Flights**: Documentation over years has shown that passengers on these flights are typically shackled for the entire duration, denied bathroom access, and subjected to severe abuse, including beatings, restrictive restraints, and reports of deaths and miscarriages.


- **Secrecy and Lack of Transparency**: Aircraft are often disguised through subcontractors and subleases, and the flights themselves are secretive and unmarked, shielding the carriers and the airport from public scrutiny.


### 🪧Signs &amp; Graphics

Please create signs and graphics that are relevant to ICE deportations &amp; the AROCC! Some ideas include:

* Abolish ICE
* ICE separates families
*42 days does not = temporary
* Illegal deportations without due process is human trafficking


###  ⚠️Protest Information

🚗 Parking is available around the intersection 

⭐ Please share with friends, family, neighbors, EVERYONE!

📸 When posting photos/videos online, please make sure to tag the Mesa Valley Indivisible social media page and clearly state Mesa Valley Indivisible as the protest organizer. The goal is to raise our group&apos;s profile which will make it easier for new people to find &amp; join our community while also increasing our influence with government officials and the media! In order to have a greater impact on our city, people have to know we exist first!!

For the past eight months, [Mesa Valley Indivisible](https://www.mesavalleyindivisible.org/) members and a coalition of groups around the country have been working relentlessly to end Avelo Airlines’ involvement in the unlawful and inhumane deportation of primarily non‑violent immigrants via Mesa Gateway Airport. 

Americans dedicated to ending Avelo&apos;s contract with ICE boycotted, protested, emailed and called our representatives/senators, held weekly meetings, etc. and on January 7, 2026, news broke that Avelo Airlines announced they were ending their ICE deportation flights!!

As we all celebrate this **HUGE WIN**, we also know ICE deportation flights are still occurring at the Mesa Gateway Airport &amp; the AROCC detention center remains active on the grounds. We can happily check off Avelo Airlines now, but it is time to move on to the next challenge which is ending ICE deportation flights &amp; closing the AROCC at our Mesa Gateway Airport! 

## 📢Join us on Saturday, March 21st, to challenge the illegal, inhumane, and unconstitutional ICE removal operations.

### 🆘Key Concerns Driving the Protest:

- **Corporate Complicity in Inhumane Practices**: These deportations are driven by profit and political patronage. Private contractors run detention and flight operations through non‑commercial hubs, creating durable infrastructure that outlasts elections. The incentive loop is clear: **more arrests → more funding → more capacity → more bodies.**


- **Conditions on the Ground**: Individuals slated for deportation or transfer are held in a secluded facility at the Mesa airport—near where commercial travelers dine—where they are reportedly kept without access to basic amenities like beds or showers until their flight.


- **Inhumane Treatment on Flights**: Documentation over years has shown that passengers on these flights are typically shackled for the entire duration, denied bathroom access, and subjected to severe abuse, including beatings, restrictive restraints, and reports of deaths and miscarriages.


- **Secrecy and Lack of Transparency**: Aircraft are often disguised through subcontractors and subleases, and the flights themselves are secretive and unmarked, shielding the carriers and the airport from public scrutiny.


### 🪧Signs &amp; Graphics

Please create signs and graphics that are relevant to ICE deportations &amp; the AROCC! Some ideas include:

* Abolish ICE
* ICE separates families
*42 days does not = temporary
* Illegal deportations without due process is human trafficking


###  🚨Protest Information

* Parking is available around the intersection 

* Please share with friends, family, neighbors, EVERYONE!

* When posting photos/videos online, please make sure to tag the Mesa Valley Indivisible social media page and clearly state Mesa Valley Indivisible as the protest organizer. The goal is to raise our group&apos;s profile which will make it easier for new people to find &amp; join our community while also increasing our influence with government officials and the media! In order to have a greater impact on our city, people have to know we exist first!!

<h3>Send Postcards to Unregistered Voters who can expand our coalition!</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, February 3, 2026 at 12:30 AM UTC - 2:30 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Fate Brewing Company - Phoenix<br>4445 N 7th St<br>Phoenix, AZ 85014</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Desert Democracy</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>This is a proven, highly effective way to get someone to vote!
There are tens of thousands of unregistered voters in Arizona that are likely pro democracy. 
If we win the House, ICE can be held to publicly account!

We have good work to do together between now and the midterms.
This simple, tangible act can change an election. Plus, we have a great time together. 

Everyone should come, even if your budget doesn’t have room for stamps. If you can afford postcard stamps, please bring them. If you can bring some extra stamps, we’d sure appreciate it! If you don’t have time to go to the post office, but can afford them, just donate the money for the stamps and we’ll get them for you.

Good food and drink available for purchase.


*A core principle behind all Desert Democracy events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values and to act lawfully at these events. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events.*</p>

        <name>Rush-hour Resistance Rally @ ICE Field Office in Phoenix</name>
        <description><![CDATA[
<h3>Rush-hour Resistance Rally @ ICE Field Office in Phoenix</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Thursday, February 5, 2026 at 2:30 PM UTC - 3:30 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>2035 N Central Ave<br>Phoenix, AZ 85004</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Desert Democracy</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p># Welcome to the Rush-hour Resistance!


📣 [Rush Hour Resistance Rally](https://rhrr.us) began with a clear idea: **neighbors, gathering peacefully and regularly on busy nearby streets, could remind our communities that democracy is essential and that silence is unacceptable.** Over the last year, RhRR expanded from a handful of participants to multiple locations across the Valley, reaching thousands of pedestrians and motorists each week. This momentum is significant, as is the duty it brings.


🗳️ As we approach the midterm elections, our united mission is to safeguard free and fair elections and promote civic participation, particularly in local and primary races where every vote carries weight. **Our weekly rallies are more than outlets for frustration; they are consistent, visible commitments that normalize voting and democratic engagement as neighborly expectations.**


🕊️ RhRR is a peaceful, nonconfrontational movement. **Our goal is to reach the broader community, not to confront those seeking conflict.** When tensions surface, we withdraw, stay composed, and look out for one another. This discipline keeps our rallies inviting and helps newcomers feel secure joining us.


🫂 Most of all, RhRR is about people caring for one another while standing up for the future of our democracy. **Every person who shows up, every sign held, and every conversation sparked on a street corner is part of something larger and deeply hopeful.**


## Here’s what’s in store for our Thursday morning event in the Museum District, right in front of the ICE Field Office:


🕥 The event starts at 7:30 am. You are free to show up anytime, but we recommend arriving a few minutes early to introduce yourself. We end promptly at 8:30 am.

⚠️ There are many other groups protesting at that location all day, every Thursday. Some aren&apos;t quite as committed to being peaceful and nonconfrontational. RhRR only takes the first shift. What happens after is beyond our purview. 


🅿️ Parking is a bit of a challenge. Some of us park on Holly St, directly across from the ICE Field Office. We haven’t had issues before, but parking enforcement is unpredictable. If concerned, take the light rail. 


🖌️ One of RhRR’s strengths is that people feel free to express themselves. For this ICE-specific event, your signs will be focused on protecting neighbors and communities. Strong anti-ICE signs are always welcome. You may bring other signs that help articulate any of our three pillars:


- **Defending democracy and the rule of law**
- **Encouraging voting**
- **Protecting neighbors and communities** (e.g., immigrants, LGBTQIA+ people, workers, and veterans)


This approach keeps signs aligned with RhRR’s purpose, while preserving personal expression and emotional authenticity.  


🇺🇳 Flags, banners, and even inflatable costumes are welcome. Some blow lots of bubbles. While our mission is serious, humor and camaraderie matter.


😷 RhRRs are peaceful, public events. Most attendees don’t hide their faces, though some do; participate at your comfort level. Photos and videos are common on social media, but you can ask posters to remove accidental appearances.


Thanks in advance for joining us. See you on the streets! ✊Votin</p>

<h3>Press Conference: Lawmakers Should Lower Costs, Not Tear Families Apart</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Thursday, February 5, 2026 at 3:45 PM UTC - 4:30 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Rose Garden at the State Capitol<br>1700 W Washington St<br>Phoenix, AZ 85007</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Opportunity Arizona</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Join us on Thursday, February 5th at 8:45am to demand Arizona lawmakers to pass bills that will actually lower the cost of housing, healthcare, groceries, and utility bills. 

With a Republican controlled legislature, affordability bills are not getting a committee hearing. Instead, Arizona Republicans are focused on the wrong things like giving more power to ICE or researching &quot;Trump Derangement Syndrome.&quot; While Arizona families are struggling to put food on the table, pay rent, and stay safe, bills to address these problems are getting ignored.  

List of speakers includes:

 - State Representative Mariana Sandoval from LD 23

 - State Representative Stephanie Simacek from LD2

 - State Senator Priya Sundareshan from LD 18

 - Impacted community member

Show up to demand better for Arizona.</p>

<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Northwest Valley Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>### **Weekly Protest: NO ICE FACILITY IN SURPRISE!**

📍 **Bell Rd &amp; Civic Center Dr, Surprise, AZ**  
🕘 **Every Saturday | 9:00–10:30 AM**

We are protesting weekly in Surprise, AZ in response to the ongoing overreach of ICE across the country, and the massive ICE facility coming to Surprise.

*A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values and to act lawfully at these events. Weapons of any kind should not be brought to events.*

As residents of **Arizona’s 8th &amp; 9th Congressional Districts**, we are calling on our representatives, **Abe Hamadeh and Paul Gosar**, to publicly address and oppose federal enforcement actions that endanger civil rights and community safety. Protecting constituents from government overreach is a core responsibility of elected office.

**Our demands:**

- No ICE facilities in Surprise  
- No new funding for ICE without real reform  
- Investigate the killings of Renee Good &amp; Alex Pretti
- End aggressive dragnet operations and mass surveillance  
- Restore transparency, accountability, and due process  

**Suggested messages for signs:**

- NO ICE FACILITY IN SURPRISE  
- JUSTICE FOR RENEE GOOD  
- JUSTICE FOR ALEX PRETTI  
- FREEZE ICE FUNDING  
- END ICE NOW  
- BELIEVE YOUR EYES NOT TRUMP’S LIES  
- NO ICE IN AZ  
- DUE PROCESS FOR ALL  

This protest is rooted in **nonviolence, clarity, and solidarity**. We welcome community members who believe no agency should operate above the law and that state power must be constrained by constitutional rights and public oversight.

**Bring signs, bring water, and bring your voice.**

**Parking:** Plenty of parking is available on the south side of Bell Rd. Please stay out of the urgent care parking lot at the corner and avoid parking near business entrances.

**Peaceful protest. No violence. No harassment. No escalation.**

- Refuse to partner with or fund private detention operators through city contracts

- Require transparency about how this facility will operate and affect our community  

Residents must sign up in advance to speak:

Join us for a **peaceful protest on the sidewalk outside City Hall** during the meeting. Your presence helps reinforce the message being delivered inside.

**Recommended sign:**  
**NO ICE DETENTION IN SURPRISE!**

This is about sustained, visible community pressure.  
Show up. Speak out. Stay engaged.</p>

Week Of Action In Honor Of Alex Pretti, RN &amp; 
All Others Killed By ICE

As frontline essential workers in healthcare, home care and the public sector, we provide care and critical services to every person we serve with humanity, dignity and compassion.
Join SEIU Local 1107 members in honoring Alex Pretti and all who have been murdered by ICE, as well as demand that congress vote to immediately abolish this violent, racist, and lawless agency that poses a dire public health threat to all of our communities.

Alex Pretti, an intensive care unit nurse in Minneapolis, approached his work with the same spirit and compassion that we all bring to our professions. Alex, an AFGE union member, in service to his community, was violently brought to the ground, pepper-sprayed and shot in the back multiple times by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. Members of SEIU 1107 mourn the loss of a fellow care provider, union member and advocate for all.</p>

<h3>FEB 6th! - Handmaids of LV - ICE OUT NOW! Downtown Las Vegas 3pm</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Friday, February 6, 2026 at 11:00 PM UTC - 12:30 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>ICE OFFICE - Downtown Las Vegas<br>501 Las Vegas Blvd S<br>Las Vegas, NV 89101</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Handmaids Las Vegas</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Join the Handmaids of Las Vegas: ICE Out for GOOD - We Stand With Minnesota!

Dear compassionate souls of Las Vegas,

Wednesday, January 7, 2026 an American citizen was killed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement )ICE) in Minneapolis, Minnesota and now another life, Alex Pretti, has been taken by ICE. These killings are part of a broader pattern of unchecked violence, impunity and abuse carried out by federal immigration enforcement agencies against members of our communities.

A broad coalition of groups across the country is calling for a coordinated solidarity actions to stand and say ICE OUT FOR GOOD! with Minnesota, and to demand accountability, honor the lives lost, and make visible the human cost of ICE&apos;s actions.

A core principle behind all ICE Out events is a commitment to nonviolent action and no civil disobedience. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values, and to act lawfully at these events. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events. All events should be held in public spaces or on public property. Handmaids of Las Vegas are managing data and communications with participants. By registering for this event, you agree to receive info from the Handmaids of Las Vegas about the event, receive communications via email and/or SMS messages, and receive any other updates and opportunities to take action or support ICE OUT STANDS AND PARCHES. You also agree to have any data entered in this registration collected by Handmaids of Las Vegas. We will treat your data according to our organizations privacy policy.

We invite you to join the Handmaids of Las Vegas as we unite in a powerful demonstration of solidarity for immigrant rights. On February 6, 2026, we will gather every other Friday at the ICE Offices in Downtown Las Vegas. Our stands will take place from 3pm PM to 4:30 PM, where we will stand together, clad in the iconic red uniforms of the handmaids, to echo the call for justice and equality.

A Stand for Dignity and Humanity Under the current Trump regime, immigrants and people of color have faced cruel and inhumane treatment. Families have been torn apart, and countless individuals have been subjected to unjust policies that strip away their dignity and rights. We believe that every person deserves to be treated with respect and compassion, regardless of their background or origin.

How You Can Show Support Join Us: Wear red and stand with us in solidarity. Your presence will amplify our message and show that our community stands united.

Together, We Rise This is not just a call to action; it is a call to the heart. By standing together, we send a powerful message that we will not remain silent in the face of injustice. Let us continue to stand until justice prevails, and every individual is treated with the respect they deserve.

Join us, bring your compassion, and be a part of a movement that believes in the power of unity and love. Together, we can create a brighter, more just future for all.

With hope and determination,

The Handmaids of Las Vegas</p>

<h3>Spokane SURJ Circle</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Sunday, February 1, 2026 at 11:00 PM UTC - 1:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Spokane Liberty Park Library<br>402 S Pittsburg St<br>Spokane, WA 99202</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Showing Up for Racial Justice</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Join our local SURJ Circle! 

Our emotions are intense, and our fear is real. It’s hard to know where to turn or what to do next when everything feels so uncertain. Renee Good and Alex Pretti should be alive today.  ICE is out of control in Minnesota– and organizers on the ground there are calling for national solidarity. No single action, no single leader will stop the dismantling of democracy or end the violence and fear unleashed by ICE. It&apos;s people standing together taking sustained, collective action over time that makes a difference.

In moments like this, when the harm feels overwhelming, we must reach out, get connected and grow our power to build the world we want—not for billionaires—but for regular people. We want good health care for everyone, affordable homes and safe neighborhoods.

Come attend a local meeting to get grounded with others, get clear on how we got here – and get organized to protect our immigrant neighbors and stop Trump&apos;s agenda.

Showing Up for Racial Justice (SURJ) is the largest organization in the US that explicitly organizes white communities for racial and economic justice-- because white people have a responsibility to step up and make sure our communities take a stand. Sign up to join us in the fight!</p>

<h3>ICE Out of Escondido Rally</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 28, 2026 at 6:00 PM UTC - 8:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Ash&amp; East Valley Parkway<br>E Valley Pkwy<br>Escondido, CA 92027</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> We The People - Troubled Nation</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Saturday, February 28, 2026
10:00 AM – 12:00 PM
Ash &amp; East Valley Parkway, Escondido

On February 28, our community in Escondido will join people across the country in demanding that businesses and public places take responsibility for what is happening on their premises. We will gather on East Valley Parkway to honor Carlos Roberto Montoya, who was killed during an ICE raid at a commercial location in Southern California, and to stand with all those who have been detained, terrorized, or abducted in and around businesses and public spaces nationwide.
This day of action is our chance to make our voices heard.

Tell Escondido: ICE Out!
Across the United States, ICE agents have been targeting immigrants in and around businesses and public places—stalking parking lots, confronting day laborers, and instilling fear in workers, customers, and surrounding neighborhoods. These raids are chaotic, violent, and too often deadly. In August, in Monrovia near Los Angeles, Carlos Roberto Montoya, a day laborer from Guatemala, lost his life while fleeing an ICE raid. He ran toward the freeway in fear and was struck by a car.

These tragedies are happening on the watch of businesses and public institutions.
On their property.
With their silence.

Too many Escondido businesses have not condemned these raids, have not demanded that the Administration stop targeting people on their premises, and have not taken meaningful steps to protect the workers and community members who rely on these spaces. By refusing to speak out or intervene, they allow their properties to become hunting grounds that feed arrest quotas, private detention centers, and the spread of fear in immigrant communities.

We demand that Escondido businesses and public institutions immediately:
1.	Publicly condemn ICE raids on their property
2.	Prohibit federal immigration enforcement from using their parking lots or public areas to target day laborers or community members
3.	Commit to creating safe, welcoming spaces for all people regardless of status

If anyone is unsafe in these spaces, then we are all unsafe. If businesses and public institutions stay silent, they will be complicit—and they will face not only moral shame, but the loss of trust and support across the U.S. and beyond.

On February 28, Escondido will stand up and say no more.
Join us. Bring your voice, your presence, and your solidarity.
Together we can demand accountability, dignity, and safety for all.

¡ICE Fuera de Escondido – Manifestación Comunitaria!
Sábado, 28 de febrero de 2026
10:00 AM – 12:00 PM
East Valley Parkway, Escondido

El 28 de febrero, nuestra comunidad en Escondido se unirá a personas de todo el país para exigir que los negocios y los espacios públicos asuman responsabilidad por lo que está ocurriendo en sus instalaciones. Nos reuniremos en East Valley Parkway para honrar a Carlos Roberto Montoya, quien murió durante una redada de ICE en un lugar comercial del sur de California, y para solidarizarnos con todas las personas que han sido detenidas, aterrorizadas o secuestradas en negocios y espacios públicos en todo el país.
Este día de acción es nuestra oportunidad para alzar la voz.

¡Escondido dice: ICE Fuera!
En todo Estados Unidos, agentes de ICE han estado atacando a inmigrantes en negocios y espacios públicos—acechando estacionamientos, confrontando a jornaleros e infundiendo miedo en trabajadores, clientes y vecindarios enteros. Estas redadas son caóticas, violentas y con demasiada frecuencia mortales. En agosto, en Monrovia, cerca de Los Ángeles, Carlos Roberto Montoya, un jornalero de Guatemala, perdió la vida mientras huía de una redada de ICE. Corrió hacia la autopista por miedo y fue atropellado por un automóvil.
Estas tragedias están ocurriendo bajo la mirada de negocios e 

instituciones públicas.
En sus propiedades.
Con su silencio.

Demasiados negocios en Escondido no han condenado estas redadas, no han exigido que la Administración deje de atacar a personas en sus instalaciones y no han tomado medidas significativas para proteger a los trabajadores y miembros de la comunidad que dependen de estos espacios. Al negarse a hablar o intervenir, permiten que sus propiedades se conviertan en terrenos de cacería que alimentan cuotas de arrestos, centros de detención privados y la propagación del miedo en las comunidades inmigrantes.

Exigimos que los negocios e instituciones públicas de Escondido:
1.	Condenen públicamente las redadas de ICE en sus propiedades
2.	Prohíban que agentes de inmigración utilicen sus estacionamientos o áreas públicas para atacar a jornaleros o miembros de la comunidad
3.	Se comprometan a crear espacios seguros y acogedores para todas las personas, sin importar su estatus migratorio
Si alguien no está seguro en estos espacios, entonces nadie lo está. Si los negocios y las instituciones públicas permanecen en silencio, serán cómplices—y enfrentarán no solo vergüenza moral, sino también la pérdida de confianza y apoyo en todo el país.

El 28 de febrero, Escondido se levantará para decir basta ya.
Acompáñanos. Trae tu voz, tu presencia y tu solidaridad.
Juntas y juntos podemos exigir responsabilidad, dignidad y seguridad para todas las personas.</p>

<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>*A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*

Hi Everyone:

I&apos;m trying to think out of the box for ways to utilize Indivisible to organize a lot of Good Trouble ... 

You might have all heard about the badass warriors who made a point of all going to Home Depot to purchase an *ice scraper* with a CREDIT CARD if you can ... and then standing back in line 5 minutes later to return it ... (google it - people are so creative) .

***NEW IDEA***. Same thing, but buy a few screws with your credit card (it adds fees for HD) ... then when you return it a few minutes later, tell the employee to SCREW ICE ... make sure they know the reason you are returning !!!!

Well, how about we all just do that at our own leisure? 

I tried it last week - it was a success, and it made me feel better LOL ...

Here is what you can do ... as often as you can manage it ... work it into your routines if you have to!   I plan on doing it after my protests - on the way home !  

Go to Home Depot ... walk around and &quot;shop&quot; for as long as you want -- I like to go and just PAY ATTENTION -- I now know exactly what they look like from the hotel protests - I hear they like to cosplay as construction workers to fit in!  (they still stick out like a sore thumb in my book).  Have a WHISTLE ready to warn people if you see anything sus .......

Buy California&apos;s version of an &quot;ice scraper &quot;   I bought a small putty knife for 98 cents ...   ***NEW IDEA ... buy a few screws and return them saying SCREW ICE!!!***

PAY by your CREDIT CARD if you can - for extra bonus points (they get charged a fee no matter what is purchased with a credit card -- win win) ...

Then, immediately walk right back in the store and go to the Customer Service line to RETURN it !

I told the nice lady (remember it is NOT the employees fault their employers are not-c&apos;s ...kindness matters), that I was returning this &quot;ice scraper&quot; in solidarity with my friends in the community - to send a message that we do not welcome thugs into our neighborhoods to terrorize our friends!    All with a smile on my face ... she almost cried when she said, I totally understand !!   and happily returned my buck back to my credit card ...

ANYONE can make this happen -- if you are looking for a way to RESIST with us, but being on a street corner is intimidating (no judgment, we all do what we feel comfy with), well THIS little Good Trouble Causing mission is for you!!!

Bonus points if you then post about it on your social media platforms to encourage others to do this simple act!

They shut down a Home Depot (upper Cali) when they had 100&apos;s of people doing this AT THE SAME TIME ...

So, for now, let&apos;s just do it on our own ... whenever you can!

*Next up:  an actual protest in front of that same Home Depot - maybe we can coordinate it to do the ice scraper thing first, and then protest them afterward ... either on the main road, or right in front of their store ...........*

Beeeeeeep

<h3>ICE OUT OF SAN DIEGO</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Thursday, February 5, 2026 at 6:30 PM UTC - 8:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>880 Front St<br>San Diego, CA 92101</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> San Diego &amp; Imperial Counties Labor Council, AFL-CIO</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Across the country, families are feeling the consequences of federal overreach. From attacks on due process and civil liberties to efforts to silence the free press and limit public access to information, these actions threaten the foundation of our democracy.

Everyday people are paying the price while those in power play political games with our rights and freedoms. These are not just policy choices; they are moral decisions that test who we are as a nation and whether we will stand up for justice, truth, and accountability.

Democracy dies in the dark. Now is the time to raise our voices, defend our rights, and demand transparency and fairness from those who claim to lead in our name.

Join us every Thursday outside the Federal Building (880 Front Street, San Diego) to demand that Washington fund care — not chaos. Together, we can send a clear message:

Gather at 10:30am and speaking program begins at 11:00am

• Healthcare is a human right.

• Food is a human right.

• San Diego stands for care, not chaos and cruelty.

This is more than a protest! It’s a stand for dignity, justice, and the right of every family to live free from fear. Bring your friends, your signs, and your voice. Together, we can show that San Diego stands for community, not cages. For more information contact us at cipriano.vargas@sdcounty.ca.gov</p>

<h3>ICE Out For Good Oceanside</h3>

<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Oceanside Civic Center<br>330 N Coast Hwy<br>Oceanside, CA 92054</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Turn Up The Noise: Together We Are Making A Difference. Stand together for justice, our immigrant community, and against the cruelty of ICE. 

American citizens, Dreamers, legal immigrants and undocumented immigrants are being killed, injured and imprisoned by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). This is part of their broader pattern of unchecked violence, impunity, and abuse. Federal agencies are being turned against children, parents, BIPOC, the working class, and people exercising their First Amendment rights. 

A core principle behind all ICE Out For Good events is a commitment to nonviolent action and no civil disobedience. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values, and to act lawfully at these events. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events. All events should be held in public spaces or on public property.

Indivisible is managing data and communications with participants. By registering, you agree to receive info from Indivisible about the event, receive communications via e-mail or SMS message from Indivisible, and receive any other updates and opportunities to take action or support ICE OUT FOR GOOD partner organizations.

### WHAT TO BRING: ###

- your signs (please keep your messages family-friendly)
- food and essential items for mutual aid (see above)
- flags of all kinds

<h3>Protest Every Monday in Brea</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, February 3, 2026 at 1:00 AM UTC - 2:30 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>The Busiest Intersection in Brea<br>Imperial Highway &amp; State College Boulevard<br>Brea, CA 92821</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>## Join INDIVISIBLE CA-45 in Brea for a high visibility **PEACEFUL protest**

### RAIN CANCELS - Rain on the windshield and on the road and dark of night is a dangerous combination at the busiest intersection in Brea.

#### We will rally on every corner of the intersection of Imperial Highway and State College Boulevard in Brea, CA 92821. During rush hour, many thousands of cars will be passing by.

Some new safety guidelines starting November 3rd:
1.	 Do not cross streets unless absolutely necessary.  Select a corner for the rally and stay there.  (This is for your safety, as when it is dark drivers cannot see you as well. All of our close-calls have been with people crossing the street.)
2.	Remain behind the tape placed along the curb.
3.	For your signs to be more easily seen and read – please use white posters with black or dark lettering. (The artwork is pretty, but more difficult to see in the dark!)
4.	Try to stay in well lit areas.  Wear light colored clothing.

### Protest for Democracy, the Rule Of Law, and **FREEDOM OF SPEECH**

## Protest against the brutality of ICE !!!

### Bring your signs

### Bring your flags.

## BRING YOUR COSTUME!

# Please be safe!

**DO NOT PARK anywhere in the shopping area on the southwest corner of Imperial and State College.** Southeast and Northeast corners are best.

This a local Indivisible event!
**A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to _DE-ESCALATE_ any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.**</p>

<h3>Whittier Indivisible Chapter Weekly Strategy Meeting</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Friday, February 6, 2026 at 3:30 AM UTC - 4:30 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Come one, come all! We are the Whittier Indivisible Chapter, and we meet weekly on Zoom to discuss, share, plan, and listen. We engage in local, in-person efforts in our community as well as national initiatives. The majority of our members are from surrounding cities in addition to Whittier, CA. 

This a local Indivisible event! We strictly abide by and follow Indivisible leadership and protocol, and do not tolerate any behavior that is disrespectful, discriminating, or hateful in any way. 

Whittier Indivisible is a Southern California-based grassroots group committed to defending democracy, resisting authoritarianism, and standing up for the dignity and rights of all people—documented or undocumented. Rooted in Whittier and welcoming to all from surrounding communities, we are proudly pro-immigrant and oppose ICE overreach, racism, and any policy that dehumanizes or divides. We believe all people—regardless of immigration status, race, gender, disability, faith, or identity—have inherent worth, value, and dignity, and are entitled to the rights guaranteed by the Constitution, including due process, free speech, and equal protection under the law. We advocate for social and economic justice, environmental protection, and individual freedoms, while standing firmly against fascism and authoritarianism in all forms. As a community, we practice gracious and respectful communication, and value inclusivity, accessibility, diversity, equity, honesty, kindness, and ambition in our organizing. We believe strong, compassionate local action can create a more just, democratic, and sustainable future for all.

*A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*

<h3>ICE OUT NOW! Overpass Action in Lakewood</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Monday, February 2, 2026 at 11:30 PM UTC - 1:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>20708 Harvest Ave<br>Lakewood, CA 90715</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Long Beach Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Join Long Beach &amp; Lakewood Indivisible’s on the pedestrian bridge over the 605 Freeway between Centralia St and Del Amo Blvd in Lakewood. We’ll display a message of ICE OUT NOW!  in response to the latest brutal murders of Renee Good and Alex Pretti in Minneapolis, and for all those who have lost their lives or been brutalized by the immoral and  lawless ICE aggression in our communities. Bring flags and wave to passing vehicles, or drive by and honk in support. 

There have already been 9 ICE related deaths in 2026. The most recent brutal and video recorded killings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti in Minneapolis are well known. ICE also shot and killed Keith Porter. Parady La, Heber Sanchaz Dominguez, Victor Manuel Diaz, Luis Beltran Yanez-Cruz, Luis Gustavo Nunez Caceres, and Geraldo Lunas Campos died in ICE custody. 

Silverio Villegas Gonzalez was shot and killed by ICE in 2025 and 32 people died in ICE custody in 2025,  ICE&apos;s deadliest year in two decades. These deaths came as the Trump administration ramped up immigration enforcement, detaining a record number of people.

Let’s stand in solidarity with Minnesota, and our neighbors, to demand accountability, honor the lives lost, and make visible the human cost of ICE’s actions. 

A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values, and to act lawfully at these events. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events.</p>

<h3>Whistlemania! LBC: Neighborhood Folding Event at Watch Me</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Friday, February 20, 2026 at 2:00 AM UTC - 4:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Watch Me! Sports Bar<br>6527 E Pacific Coast Hwy Unit B-2<br>Long Beach, CA 90803</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Long Beach Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Join us at Watch Me! Sports Bar to fold zines, make whistle packs with us, and learn about how to become more involved in the opposition. They are not charging us for the use of the space and have asked that we purchase drinks or food to help support them. 

We saw the reports of Chicago residents coming together with indignant spirit and whistles around their necks to care for their neighbors and KICK ICE OUT. Following that lead, our Whistlemania! LBC goal is to put 16,000 whistle packs into the hands of Long Beach residents during the next 3 months as a sign of dissent and solidarity.

YOU CAN HELP.

No time to sit and fold? This is also a great time to pick up whistle packs for you and your co-workers, your social club or your extended family (while supplies last). https://linktr.ee/whistlemanialbc

Despite terrible national news and the ongoing harm ICE is doing in our city, don’t let helplessness and despair set in.

Join us, we’ve got work to do!

A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.</p>

<h3>Abolish ICE Protest and Boycott | Cypress Park Home Depot</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Sunday, February 1, 2026 at 8:00 PM UTC - 10:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>2055 N Figueroa St<br>Los Angeles, CA 90065</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> NELA Alliance for Democracy</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Join us for our weekly protest against ICE Raids happening in NELA, LA, and across the country! We will rally with our Died in Detention Placards to acknowledge the impact of the Raids, with families being ripped apart and the senseless deaths.

ICE amped up the attacks on our neighborhoods in NELA these past weeks. We are continuing with the pressure to stop these brutal attacks on our community and across the nation. 

These raids are a part of a broader pattern of unchecked violence, impunity, and abuse carried out by federal immigration enforcement agencies against members of our communities. We demand accountability for the killings and an end to ICE and CBP raids. We will not sit by while violence goes unanswered and our communities are terrorized.

We demand accountability, honor the lives lost, and will make visible the human cost of ICE’s actions.</p>

<h3>Whistlemania! LBC: Neighborhood Folding Event at Sports Basement</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Friday, February 27, 2026 at 1:30 AM UTC - 3:30 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Sports Basement Long Beach<br>2100 N Bellflower Blvd<br>Long Beach, CA 90815</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Long Beach Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>This event in the community space upstairs at Sports Basement, check with the front desk or follow signs to find us. 

Fold zines, make whistle packs with us, and learn about how to become more involved in the opposition.

We saw the reports of Chicago residents coming together with indignant spirit and whistles around their necks to care for their neighbors and KICK ICE OUT. Following that lead, our Whistlemania! LBC goal is to put 16,000 whistle packs into the hands of Long Beach residents during the next 3 months as a sign of dissent and solidarity.

YOU CAN HELP.

No time to sit and fold? This is also a great time to pick up whistle packs for you and your co-workers, your social club or your extended family (while supplies last). https://linktr.ee/whistlemanialbc

Despite terrible national news and the ongoing harm ICE is doing in our city, don’t let helplessness and despair set in.

Join us, we’ve got work to do!

A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.</p>

<h3>Find Your Furever Valentine: Pet Supply Drive and Adoption Event</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 14, 2026 at 7:00 PM UTC - 2:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Pet Supplies Plus<br>2845 Northtowne Ln<br>Reno, NV 89512</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Biggest Little Action Group</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Find your fur-ever valentine this Valentine’s Day at an adoption event and pet food drive, co-hosted by BLAG and 50501 NNV! Throughout the day from 11am-6pm stop by Pet Supplies Plus to meet some paw-sitively adorably fur babies in need of a loving home, or drop off pet supplies anytime that will be donated to local rescues in need. 
  -  Cat adoption from 11am-3pm, thanks to Feral at Heart Cat Rescue
  -  Dog adoption from 3pm-6pm, thanks to Boxers and Buddies Dog Rescue
  -  Reptile adoption from 3pm-6pm, thanks to MTNGEMZ Reptile Rescue

This event will also bring awareness to the fact that when ICE thugs savagely separate families, this includes pets. After community members are abducted from our streets or from their home, ICE thugs leave pets alone in the car or home, leave them to roam free, tie them to a pole outside, and in some cases beat or shoot pets. Shelters and rescues in cities invaded by ICE are overwhelmed, and animals that have been separated from their families are further traumatized or euthanized due to overcrowding. 

We will provide resources to attendees on how to plan for your pets’ safety in the event of a detainment, and provide information about becoming a foster so animals can stay together until their owners are released from detention. Our pets are our families, too. We hope to see you there!</p>

<h3>Help assemble whistle packets for community defense (Feb. 1)</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Sunday, February 1, 2026 at 10:15 PM UTC - 12:15 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Washoe County Library, Sierra View Branch<br>4001 S. Virginia St.<br>Reno, NV 89502</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Biggest Little Action Group</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>As part of our work building community defense against immigration raids, we assemble and distribute packets containing a whistle together with instructions for how to use it when you see ICE or Border Patrol, along with Know Your Rights cards.  

We distribute the whistle packets at community events in general. We also intend to distribute them to, and to make the ingredients for them available to, individual community groups who want to strengthen their own neighborhood or community ability to respond to immigration raids. For more information about the campaign to distribute whistles, see this recent KUNR interview:
[Reno Group Distributes Whistles to Help Residents Respond to Immigration Raids](https://www.kunr.org/local-stories/2025-11-17/reno-group-distributes-whistles-to-help-residents-respond-to-immigration-raids)

Assembling these are labor-intensive, but when we get together to do it, it&apos;s fun. 

Along the way, you will learn how to fold an 8-page zine -- which is just one step away from being able to make your own!*  Click for [more about our whistle campaign](https://renoactiongroup.com/whistles/)</p>

<h3>Tyranny Tuesday - Impeach! Homeland Secretary Kristi Noem🤡📱</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, February 3, 2026 at 8:00 PM UTC - 9:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Bruce R. Thompson Courthouse and Federal Building<br>400 S Virginia St.<br>Reno, NV 89501</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Northern Nevada</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Within hours of federal agents killing Alex Pretti in Minneapolis, the Trump regime fired up the spin machine. Kristi Noem — the MAGA hardliner Trump installed to run DHS — rushed to blame Pretti for his own death, falsely claiming he “brandished” a gun, wanted to “kill law enforcement,” and branding him a “domestic terrorist.” Same playbook as earlier this month after agents under her watch killed Renee Good. Lie fast, smear the victim, move on. 🚨🧢

Let’s be clear: the terror in America right now isn’t people exercising their First Amendment rights. It’s the masked, unidentified goon squads operating under DHS, CBP, and ICE — brutalizing communities as a matter of policy. Noem isn’t keeping anyone safe; she’s overseeing intimidation, racism, and lawlessness, then daring the public to swallow whatever story drops first. 👀🔥

🦺 PLEASE NOTE: INNV supports non-violent participation in civic events. By registering and attending this event, attendees take full responsibility for keeping themselves safe by following instructions from Marshals, staying within the boundaries of the event, and de-escalating situations if you are confronted.</p>

<h3>Biggest Little Action Group February Planning Meetings</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Thursday, February 5, 2026 at 2:00 AM UTC - 3:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>First Congressional Church of Reno<br>627 Sunnyside Dr<br>Reno, NV 89503</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Biggest Little Action Group</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Join us to discuss alternatives to the usual protests. If you&apos;re tired of standing on sidewalks waving signs at cars, we plan and perform meaningful actions designed to encourage and strengthen each other in opposition to fascism.

Some actions we&apos;ve done this year include displaying portraits of the victims of ICE disappearances at the federal courthouse and at Reno&apos;s baseball stadium; creating and distributing Know Your Rights information to interstate passengers on Greyhound and Amtrak; calling for citizens to make public comment at the Board of Commissioners meeting to testify against the cooperation between ICE and the county jail; and organizing opposition to the local Republican congressman and his reluctance to hold a town hall. We&apos;re also the people responsible for displaying antifascist messages over I-80 during rush hour. Some of our individual members are involved in community defense networks like ICE Response and Court Accompaniment. We do as much as we can and welcome new ideas and new members all the time.

We are nonviolent and non-vandalizing. We work in support of democracy and the Constitution, and against the fascist actions of the Trump administration, its supporters, and its enablers. Everyone can play a role in this fight. Come and see if you like our style.</p>

<h3>Training: Best Practices for Effective Activism</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Thursday, February 19, 2026 at 3:00 AM UTC - 5:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Torrance Municipal Airport - Zamperini Field<br>3301 Airport Dr<br>Torrance, CA 90505</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible South Bay LA</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>The Trump administration continues to trample the constitution and violate people&apos;s human rights.  Between foreign invasions, trade wars, and vilification of our allies, they are damaging America&apos;s place in the world.  And their use of ICE to attack innocent civilians is criminal and in support of an unabashed agenda of white supremacy and nativism.

The training will be about the most effective ways we can fight this as individuals, along with the power of working in groups and coalitions.  We&apos;ll discuss best practices for protests, rallies, and boycotts; best approaches to contacting elected representatives; and ways to make a difference in competitive elections.

This will be an interactive session, where we can talk together and practice effective tactics.  Please join us!</p>

If you cannot attend in person, you can still make an impact by amplifying posts from the national campaign on social media and sharing coverage with your network.

Let’s remind corporations, elected officials, and the community:
our power goes far beyond the ballot — we control where we put our dollars, our attention, and our bodies.

See you on the corner.

A core principle behind all Indivisible and 50501 events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.

<h3>ICE Out - Solidarity with Minnesota Rally</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Sunday, February 1, 2026 at 8:00 PM UTC - 10:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Roseville Galleria<br>Roseville Parkway &amp; Galleria Boulevard<br>Roseville, CA 95678</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Roseville CA</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>ICE Out of Everywhere!

ICE agents are brutally beating and killing innocent people in the streets of Minneapolis and other American cities.  They are using escalating force, macing and tear gassing peaceful observers, detaining people including children, breaking into homes with no warrants and terrorizing entire communities.  Enough is enough!  When did America turn into a fascist state?  We will not normalize this violence and we refuse to stay silent!  

Our own Federal government has weaponized ICE against us and they are lying about what we see happening with our own eyes.  Bring your voice, signs, noisemakers, cowbells, whistles, music, etc. and join us as were rise up in protest!  We must not let this stand!  We demand accountability and justice for Nicole Good and Alex Pretti who were murdered in cold blood by cowardly ICE thugs.  

A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action and no civil disobedience. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values, and to act lawfully at these events. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events. All events should be held in public spaces or on public property.

<h3>Demand McClintock Defend the Constitution - National Day of Lobbying</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, February 17, 2026 at 10:00 PM UTC - 11:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>McClintock&apos;s Modesto Office<br>1020 15th St<br>Modesto, CA 95354</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> 50501 California</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>It&apos;s been one heck of a year! We&apos;ve seen flagrant violations of the constitution by this administration, in many areas. This is not normal politics. This is not simply disagreements in how government should run. 

Let&apos;s join together and let McClintock know how we feel on this National Day of Lobbying. Our main messages are: impeach Trump, abolish ICE, defend the constitution. Other relevant topics include:
- repeated violations of the constitution by the Trump administration
- reckless abuse of power by DHS &amp; ICE, resulting in deaths of American citizens
- human rights violations in ICE detention facilities
- majority of ICE arrests have no criminal record
- our allies have been treated disrespectfully and have been turned into adversaries
- tariffs have not been effective &amp; a Times investigation shows 96% of tariff costs are paid by the US consumer
- failure to abide by the Epstein Transparency Act &amp; an apparent continued coverup of Epstein files
- healthcare costs
- violation of the emoluments clause with Trump&apos;s business dealings and doubling his personal wealth since taking office
- the US continued support of the genocide against the Palestinian people. We must stop funding, and providing weapons to Israel.

We will request to speak to McClintock&apos;s staff, most likely in small groups. You will have the opportunity to ask a question and share your concerns.</p>

<h3>ICE OUT Weekly Protest - Downtown Bellevue</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 7, 2026 at 7:00 PM UTC - 8:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Bellevue Way Northeast &amp; Northeast 4th Street<br>Bellevue, WA 98004</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Exercise your free speech - while you still have it. Join Indivisible Eastside members in their ongoing protest of the harmful administration&apos;s policies every Saturday.

Downtown Bellevue at the corner of Bellevue Way and NE 8th St. Do not block sidewalks or roads. No walk off parking at the Bellevue Square Mall.

Hosted by Indivisible Eastside

On Wednesday, January 7th, an American citizen was killed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Minneapolis, Minnesota. This killing is part of a broader pattern of unchecked violence, impunity, and abuse carried out by federal immigration enforcement agencies against members of our communities.

We must stand up and send the strong message of ICE OUT FOR GOOD until ICE is out for good.

A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action and no civil disobedience. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values, and to act lawfully at these events. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events.

<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Renee Good deserves justice and we won&apos;t stand silently while her murder is covered up. Join our protest in honor of Renee and in solidarity with immigrant communities across the United States. 

**Join us and help send a clear message to Musk and Trump: We&apos;re not backing down. We&apos;re DOUBLING DOWN!**

Our protests have helped force Musk from DC but our work is far from done. **Tesla&apos;s stock is UP because investors think we&apos;re going to fade away** while Musk buys our elections, spews hate and lies on his social network, and bullies even conservative members of Congress into giving Trump the power of a KING.

The stakes couldn’t be higher. No one is coming to save us. Not politicians, not the media, not the courts. **Our democracy has never faced someone with so much money and so little shame as Elon Musk.**

Please, join us. We need your voice. Let&apos;s make some noise!

See you Saturday! 

Tesla Takedown is a peaceful protest movement. We oppose violence, vandalism and destruction of property. Please treat Tesla drivers with respect as they are most likely on our side!

<h3>Friday Function in the Junction</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Friday, February 6, 2026 at 11:30 PM UTC - 12:30 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Skyway &amp; Neal Road<br>Paradise, CA 95969</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>“Get in good trouble, necessary trouble, and help redeem the soul of America.” - John Lewis

During Friday Function in the Junction, bring American flags, if you have them. Wear bright colored clothing, bring your choice of resistance posters.

We will push the crosswalk button. After the first row of cars come to a complete stop, we will cross Skyway together inside the crosswalk. Then let cars go by, as we wait for our turn to again cross Skyway.

If you don’t feel comfortable walking, or just want to come out for support, feel free to bring a chair and enjoy the protest music.

To make car honking be your friend, bring a sign to encourage honking, such as:

“Honk for Peace”
“Honk in memory of Renee Good (or Alex Pretti)
“Honk to stop ICE
“Honk for Remaining Epstein Files

MAGA or not, these are our neighbors in a small community, so be kind. If drivers wish to argue, wish them a good evening.

<h3>Time to Act 2026!</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Sunday, February 1, 2026 at 8:00 PM UTC - 9:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Swing Left</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>It’s 2026—and Democracy is on the line. Will you step up and take action to help preserve our hard-won democratic norms freedoms, before they are crippled beyond repair?

You’ve seen the immense damage that Trump and MAGA have already done. They followed Project 2025 very closely (despite Trump disavowing it before the 2024 election), and now they want more. Venezuela. Greenland. ICE shootings in Minneapolis, Portland, and ______(?). Attacking opponents left and right. It’s downright scary.

And there’s more on the agenda… including possibly trying to cancel or invalidate the 2026 election.

**Not. On. Our. Watch.**

2026 is also the year we **Fight Back,** and we NEED YOUR HELP. Please join us for an upcoming Time to Act training with Seattle Supports Democracy/Swing Left Seattle.

In this one-hour Zoom session, we’ll teach you how to:

   -Take effective action to protect democracy (at whatever level you choose, from calling your reps and writing letters to direct action in the streets, and more).
    -Counter the anti-immigration agenda of the Trump administration and protect our friends and neighbors with different types of strategies.
    -Help register voters, turn them out to vote, and preserve free and fair elections for all.

We believe in taking positive action joyful (we find it&apos;s the best antidote for despair). We’ll help you identify the values and issues that are motivating you to speak out, then give you the skills and strategic knowledge to do it.

Past attendee Lisa F. said, &quot;This was an excellent training--organized, clear, and positive. I left inspired, and with a specific idea of the actions I wanted to take.&quot;

At Seattle Supports Democracy, we&apos;ve trained thousands of individuals over the last five years, activating them and helping them write letters, send texts, make calls, help others, and show up to defend our democratic freedoms and make their voices heard. Join the movement!</p>

<h3>Vigil for Alex Pretti - Elk Grove CA</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Monday, February 2, 2026 at 12:30 AM UTC - 2:30 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>In front of the Designer Shoe Warehouse (DSW)<br>Bruceville Road &amp; Laguna Boulevard<br>Elk Grove, CA 95758</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Elk Grove Laguna</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Join us this Sunday February 1st from 4:30 PM to 6:30 PM for a peaceful candlelight vigil (visibility event) as our community comes together to honor the life of Alex Pretti, who was murdered on Saturday January 24th by Trumps federal agents. Together we stand with Minneapolis, and reject the brutality carried out by federal immigration enforcement. Our outrage comes from a place of deep care for our neighbors, our families, and every person who deserves dignity and safety.  We will be in front of the Designer Shoe Warehouse (DSW) at the corner of Bruceville Road and Laguna Boulevard. 

We will hold candles, share space, and lift up the values that define us: compassion, solidarity, and the unwavering belief that every human life matters.

Bring a candle, a light, signs of solidarity, or simply your presence. 

“Statement from the family of Alex Pretti, Michael and Susan Pretti: We are heartbroken but also very angry. Alex was a kindhearted soul who cared deeply for his family and friends and also the American veterans whom he cared for as an ICU nurse at the Minneapolis VA hospital. Alex wanted to make a difference in this world. Unfortunately he will not be with us to see his impact. I do not throw around the hero term lightly. However his last thought and act was to protect a woman. The sickening lies told about our son by the administration are reprehensible and disgusting. Alex is clearly not holding a gun when attacked by Trump&apos;s murdering and cowardly ICE thugs. He has his phone in his right hand and his empty left hand is raised above his head while trying to protect the woman ICE just pushed down all while being pepper sprayed. Please get the truth out about our son. He was a good man. Thank you.”

A core principle behind all Indivisible Elk Grove - Laguna events is a commitment to nonviolent action and no civil disobedience. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values, and to act lawfully at these events. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events. All events should be held in public spaces or on public property.

Remind yourself of your rights as a protester here &gt;&gt; https://www.aclu.org/know-your-rights/protesters-rights Please bring signs or other props for attention.</p>

<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>**Alex Pretti and Renee Good deserve justice** and we won&apos;t stand silently while her murder is covered up. Join our protest in honor of Renee and in solidarity with immigrant communities across the United States.

Join us for Tesla Takedown Tuesday and help send a clear message to Musk and Trump: We&apos;re not backing down. We&apos;re DOUBLING DOWN!

Our protests have helped force Musk from DC but our work is far from done. **Tesla&apos;s stock is UP because investors think we&apos;re going to fade away** while Musk buys our elections, spews hate and lies on his social network, and bullies even conservative members of Congress into giving Trump the power of a KING.

The stakes couldn’t be higher. No one is coming to save us. Not politicians, not the media, not the courts. **Our democracy has never faced someone with so much money and so little shame as Elon Musk.**

Please, join us. We need your voice. Let&apos;s make some noise!

See you Tuesday! 
PS. For our full schedule, check out DefundMusk.com.

Tesla Takedown is a peaceful protest movement. We oppose violence, vandalism and destruction of property. Please treat Tesla drivers with respect as they are most likely on our side!

Join Indivisible Santa Maria for a pop-up protest to honor Alex Pretti and support the cause for which he lost his life. Protest with us on Sunday, February 1st, at Broadway and Main from 1:00 to 3:00 pm. 

A core principle of all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to try to de-escalate any potential confrontations with those who disagree with our values.</p>

Join us this Sunday, 12–2 PM, at 36th &amp; Broadway!

This is the moment.
This is the line in the sand.

Project 2025 is already giving ICE cover to act outside legal limits — escalating force, detaining people without cause, and terrorizing families in broad daylight. We refuse to normalize this. We refuse to stay silent. We show up to demand accountability, transparency, and safety for our communities.

Bring your voice.
Bring your signs.
Bring your courage.

See you at 36th &amp; Broadway — visible, loud, and united.</p>

<h3>In-Person Lunchtime Meeting w/ Sen. Cantwell&apos;s Staff</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Wednesday, September 9, 2026 at 8:00 PM UTC - 8:45 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Federal Office Building<br><br>Seattle, WA 98104</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Seattle Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p># Join Seattle Indivisible for a Critical Discussion with Senator Cantwell&apos;s Staff

Join Seattle Indivisible for an engaging Zoom discussion and Q&amp;A session with staff from Senator Maria Cantwell&apos;s office. As we navigate a complex political landscape in 2025, several key issues demand our attention:

Key Issues in 2026
🧊 Paramilitary Forces Attacking Immigrants and our Cities
ICE and CPB waging illegal, violent campaigns against immigrants and Black and brown people. 


🏛️ Constitutional Concerns
The ongoing failure of institutions to protect our rights and programs established by Congress have raised serious questions about the erosion of democratic principles.

💰 Economic Uncertainty
The imposition of a federal spending freeze has led to confusion and legal challenges, impacting various programs and contributing to fiscal instability.

⚖️ Social Equity
Policies targeting marginalized communities, including restrictions on transgender rights and potential cuts to social safety nets, underscore the ongoing struggle for social justice.

Senator Cantwell has been a vocal advocate for protecting democratic institutions, promoting economic stability, and advancing social equity. This session offers a unique opportunity to engage directly with her staff on these pressing issues.

📢 Your participation is crucial in voicing concerns and influencing decisions that impact our community.

We look forward to your active involvement in shaping the future of our state and nation!</p>

<h3>Washington for All: Sign up for ICE Mobilization Alerts</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Wednesday, October 29, 2025 at 7:00 AM UTC - 8:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Washington Indivisible Network</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>## **Washington is home. We belong here.**

Working people build Washington. Whether we&apos;re picking apples in the Yakima Valley, fishing on the coast, milling lumber in Aberdeen, raising a family in Tacoma, or running small businesses in Seattle, we&apos;ve earned the right to feel safe and respected in the place we call home.

But, just like in LA &amp; Chicago, the Trump Administration has promised to keep terrorizing cities across America via increased ICE tactical units, mass raids, and deploying the National Guard,  including right here in Washington State. They want us to believe some of us don’t belong here by spreading hate and division. But who really doesn’t belong on our streets? Masked agents who are tearing apart our communities through violence instead of safety.

Trump and his billionaire backers don’t get to decide who belongs in our state. We do.

We are preparing for a variety of scenarios across our state in the event that they escalate their efforts to turn our government into a weapon against our people.

Sign up to know when it’s time for Washingtonians to come together to protect one another.

**We are standing with one purpose**: Together, we will train, organize, and communicate our shared commitment to a free and safe Washington for all.

In preparation, together we will: 

* Train on de-escalation and strategic non-cooperation   
* Make and distribute whistle kits for community defense   
* Distribute information so businesses and individuals know their legal rights

When it&apos;s time to mobilize, we will: 

* Mobilize a unified response
* Advocate for real solutions that meet our needs - like fully-funding our schools, creating good jobs and making healthcare affordable - not wasting our time and money to harass our neighbors
* Focus attention on the ICE violating our rights

### **SIGN UP FOR MOBILIZATION ALERTS &amp; SPREAD THE WORD**

### **We need all hands on deck. Washington thrives when all of us can live without fear, and our success does not come at the expense of others. This is our shared fight.**

A core value of Washington for All is a commitment to nonviolent action.</p>

<h3>ICE OUT! Justice for Pretti and Good: Tacoma</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 7, 2026 at 6:00 PM UTC - 8:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Union Station - Federal Courthouse<br>1717 Pacific Ave<br>Tacoma, WA 98402</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Seattle Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>**Alex Pretti and Renee Good deserve justice and we won&apos;t stand silently while their murders are covered up.** 

Join our protest in honor of Alex and Renee and in solidarity with immigrant communities across the United States. 

**WE CALL FOR JUSTICE FOR ICE VICTIMS AS WE FIGHT TO PROTECT OUR DEMOCRACY FROM TRUMP AND HIS OLIGARCHS.**

Our protests have helped force Musk from DC, but our work is far from done. **Tesla&apos;s stock is UP because investors think we&apos;re going to fade away** while Musk continues to spread lies and hate across the globe. 

He&apos;s been quieter lately but with midterms coming up, there&apos;s no doubt that Elon will side with the rich and powerful over the rest of us. 

The stakes couldn’t be higher. No one is coming to save us. Not politicians, not the media, not the courts. **Our democracy has never faced someone with so much money and so little shame as Elon Musk.**

Please, join us. We need your voice. Let&apos;s make some noise!

See you Saturday! 

Tesla Takedown is a peaceful protest movement. We oppose violence, vandalism and destruction of property. Please treat Tesla drivers with respect as they are most likely on our side!</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
<h3>ICE Out of SLO County! Abolish ICE!</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Sunday, February 1, 2026 at 6:00 PM UTC - 7:30 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>California 1 &amp; Kansas Avenue<br>San Luis Obispo County, CA 93405</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Rally and vigil every Sunday between 10 am - 11:30 am at the corner of Hwy 1 and Kansas Avenue. Join us for a rally to protest ICE activity in our beloved community and to hold vigil for those in our community abducted by ICE. The sheriff chooses to allow ICE agents into the jail to abduct people despite CA laws that would allow him not to cooperate. The sheriff says he transferred zero people to ICE from January 2018 to December 2024. However, he reports 69 transfers in the secure area of the jail for 2025. These transfers do not include ICE abducting people released into the jail lobby which happens routinely. 

It IS happening here! ICE is in our community multiple times a week abducting people from the SLO County jail. Imagine you are waiting for a loved one to be released from the SLO county jail.  But before you can be reunited with them, they are kidnapped by masked secret police from the jail right before your eyes.

People taken at the jail are being denied due process and legal representation. They are separated from their children, families and loved ones. Don&apos;t turn your back on what is happening in our community. Everyone who is released from the jail should be released regardless of where they were born.

Thanks to those who spoke up at the Truth Act Forum on January 27 and those who showed up in solidarity. A subcommitee taking 60 days to dither is insufficient! At least 30 people can be kidnapped from the jail in that time. 

Bring large signs and banners centering calls for abolishing ICE and keeping it out of SLO and everywhere. If featuring signs with names of people murdered by ICE, please list all the people murdered by ICE. And the countless people harmed and disappeared whose names we do not know. Please stay off the road and stay safe. 

*A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*</p>

<h3>Screw ICE! Lets get ICE out of Home Depot.</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 7, 2026 at 10:00 PM UTC - 12:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>The Home Depot<br>10120 SE Washington St<br>Portland, OR 97216</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Outer East Portland Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>*Outside the Home Depot where our neighbors gather to seek an honest day’s work, we will hold signs and flags for those who&apos;ve been taken, abused, and killed by ICE. Every worker’s life matters, and together we demand justice for all.*

### Join us for a honk and wave visibility event at the Mall 205 Home Depot as part of the national Disappeared In America campaign. ###

#### We&apos;re showing up all, across the country to speak out against the collaboration between corporations and ICE that has led to the detention, abuse, and deaths of immigrant workers. In a series of strategic actions - organzing, flyering, and buy-ins, everyday shoppers can engage in this defiance. ####

These “ICE Out of Home Depot” actions honor workers like Carlos Roberto Montoya, who lost his life while fleeing an ICE raid in Monrovia, California, and countless others who have faced harassment, racial profiling, and violence simply for seeking honest work. 

#### We call on Home Depot and other corporations to stop enabling policies that endanger immigrant workers and tear families apart communities will stand together in peaceful but firm resistance, demanding safety, solidarity and justice for all who labor.

Indivisibles are committed to non-violence as a guiding principle in everything we do. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values</p>

<h3>Indivisible PDX D3 February General Meeting</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Thursday, February 5, 2026 at 3:00 AM UTC - 5:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Montavilla United Methodist Church<br>232 SE 80th Ave<br>Portland, OR 97215</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible PDX D3</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Attend the monthly general meeting for Indivisible Portland District 3 (PDX D3)!

We will have special guest speakers: Two local activists will tell the story of witnessing an ICE abduction out in the community. They will share how they used their Migra Watch training and knowledge of local resources to jump into action on site. Following their shared experience of this horrific event event, these two community members stayed in contact with the hopes of building a supportive bridge between their communities, which has given rise to a new mutual aid project they will discuss. They will also share some practical details they learned at the incident, which they think would be helpful to know for anyone finding themselves in a similar situation in the future.

Join us to connect with other locals who are concerned about the state of American democracy and learn about ways to get involved in upcoming protests, trainings, action campaigns, and community building events.

A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.</p>

<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Greater Vancouver</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>🧊 DE-ICE OUR NEIGHBORHOODS 🧊
Wednesdays
📍 HWY 99 &amp; NE 78th St — Hazel Dell
Join Indivisible Greater Vancouver (IGV) as we regroup and bring the No ICE in Our Hotels rallies back into our neighborhoods.
This intersection has seen heightened ICE activity and abductions. We are showing up—peacefully, visibly, and together—to say:
NO to ICE brutality.
NO to lawlessness.
YES to community care and immigrant dignity.
✊ Bring your signs, your voice, and your solidarity.
💛 Let our neighbors know they are not alone.
When communities show up, fear loses its grip.

About Indivisible Greater Vancouver (IGV) - https://www.indivisiblegreatervancouver.org
Indivisible Greater Vancouver (IGV) is committed to promoting nonviolent advocacy and activism to create lasting social and political change. Founded in 2017 as a chapter of the national Indivisible movement to resist the Trump agenda, IGV has since expanded its focus to include local and Washington state grassroots organizing.
We work in partnership with organizations that share our values, including Clark County 50501, MoveOn Clark County, LULAC, Pasitos Gigantes, and the Vancouver chapter of the NAACP. Together, we build community power rooted in justice, equity, and solidarity.
IGV is deeply committed to nonviolence as both a principle and a strategy. We at IGV strongly believe that peaceful, nonviolent activism offers social movements the most power to effect change. Through peaceful protests, we set an example of making our voices heard with dignity, empowered by truth. IGV does not condone intimidation, threats, vandalism, interference with access to business or any other lawless actions. If instigators or opponents attempt to violate our commitment to non-violence, we will try to de-escalate and end the event if needed to maintain a safe environment.
You can read more about Indivisible’s national commitment to nonviolence here:
🔗 indivisible.org/commitment-nonviolence
We also value and are guided by the research of Dr. Erica Chenoweth, whose work shows that nonviolent movements are significantly more successful than violent ones in achieving lasting social and political transformation:
🔗 Paths to Resistance – Harvard Kennedy School
Together, we stand strong, peaceful, and resolute—because nonviolence is not passive. It is powerful.</p>

<h3>Silent Vigil Honoring Renee Nicole Good and Alex Jeffrey Pretti</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 7, 2026 at 1:00 AM UTC - 2:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Quincy Square, on 4th Street and Pacific Avenue<br><br>Bremerton, WA 98337</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Join community members for a silent, visible moment of remembrance honoring the lives of Renee Nicole Good and Alex Jeffrey Pretti, two residents of Minneapolis recent executed by ICE agents. We will gather at the intersection of Quincey Square and Pacific Ave. (east side, where the street is closed to traffic). This vigil coincides with the Friday Art Walk, offering a meaningful opportunity to stand together in a public space.

Participants are welcome to arrive anytime starting at a little before 5 p.m. We understand that some attendees may need to leave early to attend the WAISN Rapid Response Training scheduled for that evening.

Parking is free in the city lot on Washington Ave. starting at 5 p.m. There are additional free and paid lots throughout downtown as well as some street parking. Be sure to read signage wherever you park.

If no designated parking is available, as long as your car is displaying handicap plates or a plaque, you may park as long as needed in a regular space. 

To help create a unified and respectful presence, please consider bringing an electric candle, wearing black, or carrying a sign honoring Renee Nicole Good and Alex Jeffrey Pretti.

All are invited to stand in solidarity, reflect, and hold space for their memory.

*A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*</p>

<h3>Canby: Day Without an Immigrant</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Monday, February 16, 2026 at 8:00 PM UTC - 10:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>S Ivy St and 99E<br>Canby, OR 97013</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Join us for a sign waving event to show support for the vulnerable members of our community. Let them know they are not alone.

Location: along 99E between S Ivy St and S Grant St in Canby, OR.
Time: Monday, February 16th, 2026  from 12pm-2pm.
Parking available at Zoar Lutheran Church 190 SW 3rd Ave, Canby, OR 97013.

Endorsed by Bridging Cultures/Puentes Entre Culturas.

From PCUN (Oregon&apos;s Farmworker Union):
Immigrant workers are the backbone of Oregon&apos;s most important sectors. We came here following the American dream, and to build a better life for our families. We work the jobs nobody else will do. They are backbreaking, low-paid, and sometimes dangerous. We helped make this country the richest country in the world. We&apos;re not criminals, we&apos;re families, workers, PEOPLE!

We have seen an overwhelming increase in ICE and Border Patrol in our communities, terrorizing our children, destabilizing our local business, harming our community. We have something Trump and his cronies want, our labor, our money, our time.

No work. No shopping. No school. Join our cause!

Our goal is to get ICE Out of our barrios by building solidarity amongst allies and immigrant workers. We need other sectors to stand up against gestapo immigration enforcement, and find real solutions to our broken immigration system.

What Happens on a Day Without An Immigrant? We&apos;re asking YOU to take the day off of work, and NOT participate economically. A Day Without An Immigrant is for all sectors of the economy.

On February 16th, 2026 we want you to join Day Without An Immigrant in cities across the state. Thanks for your support!

This a local Indivisible event!

<h3>ICE OUT for Good</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 7, 2026 at 9:00 PM UTC - 10:30 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>5698 SW Canyon Ct<br>Portland, OR 97221</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Stand Up For the Truth</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Protest can feel pointless, tiresome and lonely, but it&apos;s a crucial step in building a community network that can withstand the regime&apos;s assaults.

ICE will disappear your neighbors and they will kill you. Then the regime will slander you and investigate your family. Minneapolis stood up and we can too. This revolting gang of fascists is playing for all the marbles.  Murder and kidnapping are just the beginning. The aim is subjugation and ICE is trump&apos;s own brown shirt army. It&apos;s time to stand up!

Join us most Saturdays from 1:00 to 2:30 or come at 12:30 to help set up. And bring a friend, a neighbor, your whole posse!</p>

<h3>No Ice, No Troops in Beaverton, Oregon</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Wednesday, February 4, 2026 at 11:30 PM UTC - 12:30 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>6125 SW Hall Blvd<br>Beaverton, OR 97008</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>We are getting an enthusiastic response, and people asked if we are going to do it again! So we are! ICE have been seen all over Washington County, including Beaverton, quite a bit in the past several weeks. We don’t want them here; all of our neighbors belong. And we do not need or want federal troops in Oregon. There is no invasion, no insurrection. We are peaceful protesters exercising our Constitutional right of free speech by saying no to ICE, no to federal troops including the National Guard. We are thanking our local law enforcement for doing their job and remembering that Oregon is a sanctuary state, where police are not cooperating with ICE. And we are peaceful. Bring your friends and neighbors and signs and chants, and music. Indivisible Beaverton is hosting this event. All are welcome.
  Please note time change as the days get darker to 3:30-4:30.

*A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
<h3>Day Without an Immigrant</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Monday, February 16, 2026 at 7:00 PM UTC - 9:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> PCUN (Oregon&apos;s Farmworker Union)</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Join us on February 16th from 11am-1pm for our next Day Without an Immigrant visibility action! 

We will be doing a sidewalk march in front of our State Capitol in support of our immigrant neighbors. 

Immigrant workers are the backbone of Oregon&apos;s most important sectors. We came here following the American dream, and to build a better life for our families. We work the jobs nobody else will do. They are backbreaking, low-paid, and sometimes dangerous. We helped make this country wealthy.

We have seen an overwhelming increase in ICE and Border Patrol in our communities, terrorizing our children, destabilizing our local business, harming our community. We have something Trump and his cronies want, our labor, our money, our time. 

No work. No shopping. No school. Join our cause!
Our goal is to get ICE Out of our barrios by building solidarity amongst allies and immigrant workers. We need other sectors to stand up against gestapo immigration enforcement, and find real solutions to our broken immigration system. 

What Happens on a Day Without An Immigrant? We&apos;re asking YOU to take the day off of work, and NOT participate economically. A Day Without An Immigrant is for all sectors of the economy. On the days identified below we will send opportunities to join Day Without An Immigrant in cities across the state. Thanks for your support!</p>

<h3>Tri-Valley Signs of Solidarity: Business Canvassing</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, February 3, 2026 at 9:30 PM UTC - 11:30 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Koffee Time<br>618 Main Street, Suite A, Pleasanton, CA 94566<br>Pleasanton, CA 94566</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Tri-Valley</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Join the Signs of Solidarity team to canvass local businesses, and ask them to post signs of support for our immigrant neighbors. 

There&apos;s been a significant increase in ICE agents entering small businesses without warrants and detaining people, including workers. It&apos;s created an environment where immigrants are often afraid to go to work or go shopping out of fear that ICE might show up. That&apos;s not how anyone in our community wants to live. Businesses should take steps to protect their workers and customers from these increasingly violent raids. 

No experience is necessary. A script is provided and a packet of signs; please bring a bag to carry them. You will receive a brief training and will be paired with an experienced canvasser. Please join us and and help to be part of the solution!

PLEASE NOTE: WE PLAN TO CANVASS IN MULTIPLE LOCATIONS IN THE TRI-VALLEY STARTING IN PLEASANTON ON JANUARY 27; HOWEVER, THE LOCATIONS WILL CHANGE WEEK TO WEEK.</p>

<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Join us and speak up for our democracy and community as our demonstration continue at the **Peace Corner Dublin** (Dublin Blvd/Amador Plaza Rd)! 

Thanks to your boycotting, Tesla sales came down, Avelo Airlines stopped ICE deportation flights, and Spotify stopped ICE ads. We, consumers, have power and organizing works!

We are carrying the fight onward to stand against:

- National Guard weaponized against the People
- Extreme gerrymandering to silence our voice and steal Midterm 2026
- Banning Mail-in Ballot
- Working for the wealthy few and not for the People

Bring flags (American, California, Rainbow), noise makers, music and your ideas to keep our protest fun!  
We are accepting food donations for Tri-Valley Haven Food Pantry. Check their wish list at &lt;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NCjL2k3Q_h0ifUvzqfGrztKNHZsJLtOq/edit&gt;.

**A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action.**  
We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values and to act lawfully at our event. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to the event.</p>

        <name>Letter to Mayor Kaarin Knudsen and Eugene City Council - State of Emergency</name>
        <description><![CDATA[
<h3>Letter to Mayor Kaarin Knudsen and Eugene City Council - State of Emergency</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Wednesday, January 21, 2026 at 8:00 AM UTC - 8:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Eugene - Springfield</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>### Oregon cities are writing to government officials to direct them to stand against federal immigration practices by declaring a state of emergency in Eugene over ICE enforcement that has raised intense fears. Let the state of Oregon stand in solidarity with it’s cities standing up to ICE and federal agents. 
_______________________________________________________________________________

Oregon cities are taking action as Federal agents have arrested or detained people without due process, refused to share reasons for arrests they make and questioned people about their immigration status based on race, ethnicity, accent or job, according to the declaration. And legitimate law enforcement officers do not wear masks. **Ever.**  

* **Raids target workplaces:** businesses in hospitality (restaurants, car washes, bakeries), construction, agriculture (farms, meatpacking, poultry), and retail (like Home Depot).                                                                                              
* **Educational Institutions**                                                                                                               
* **Healthcare &amp; Sensitive Locations:** Recent enforcement has included hospitals, schools, and places of worship, people in their cars and peaceful protesters.     
                                                                                                                                                        
Salem, Woodburn, Hillsborough, and Washington County are stepping up to protect the rights of the people. **“Our diversity is our strength, and we will never waiver from our commitment to serve every person who lives here with dignity.”**

Woodburn **residents and business owners** described downtown Woodburn as a &quot;ghost town&quot;  in the wake of the arrests. Officials estimated 50% to 80% fewer people were walking around the city&apos;s center.  “Keeping families together and children protected and safe is a fundamental value for Oregon cities.” 

ICE agents are arrested for alleged criminal acts like assault, violating civil rights through unlawful searches/seizures engaging in misconduct, or potentially committing crimes while on duty. 

We the undersigned, as Oregonians, and as Americans, hereby demand you add Eugene‘s declaration of a state of emergency ASAP to arrest ICE and federal agents that break the law, to the list of other Oregon cities. 

Respectfully and in Solidarity, 


The undersigned</p>

WHISTLES - A COMMUNITY SAFETY UPDATE
We love everyone&apos;s enthusiasm with their various noise-makers but note that whistles are now used for ICE warnings. In order to avoid undue fear, confusion or panic for our communities, please refrain from using whistles hereafter for any protest events.  Bells and horns are alternatives. 

Fight back against the Trump Regime and the extremist budget cuts, kidnappings by masked goons, and attempted military take-over of our cities, cuts to Medicaid and Medicare. Due Process for all! People over profit! Billionaires should not rule America. ICE/Military out of our communities! Bring your own sign!

These are nonviolent events. Each of us is responsible for our own conduct. Stay within your rights, don’t break laws, stay safe, stay peaceful, and avoid any risk you don’t feel comfortable with. Don’t obstruct traffic, protest inside any business, impede people from entering or exiting any property, or commit any acts of property damage. Ignore any counter protestors and stay focused on peacefully delivering our message. If you need help or see something troubling, tell a uniformed police officer or call 911. If you can safely do so, record troublesome behavior with your phone, as this is often a strong deterrent to bad behavior.</p>

<h3>Paper &amp; Purpose: Folding Zines for Change</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 7, 2026 at 12:30 AM UTC - 2:30 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Mariya&apos;s<br>757 San Carrizo Way<br>Mountain View, CA 94043</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> It&apos;s Blue Turn</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>**Zines are grassroots media**: small, folded booklets made by and for the people. They’ve long been used by movements to amplify voices, challenge injustice, and share knowledge in a way that’s personal, creative, and hard to ignore.

At this **in-person folding event in Mountain View**, we’ll turn stacks of printed pages into tools for change. We’ll fold, we’ll talk, and we’ll build something together. These zines will go directly into the hands of people at rallies, info tables, and on the street.

In the past, we&apos;ve created zines on why we fight illegal deportations without due process, attacks on voting rights, harm to working families. At this session, we&apos;ll be making zines in preparation for our **[ICE Out: Super Bowl edition](https://www.mobilize.us/indivisible/event/886224/)** protest and **[Fighting for America: How We Win 2026](https://www.mobilize.us/itsblueturn/event/884935/)**, both on Saturday, Feb.7.

If you’ve got a knack for **crisp, careful folds**, we’d especially love your help, no experience needed!

**See you soon!**</p>

<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Gateway Plaza<br>790 W El Camino Real<br>Mountain View, CA 94040</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> It&apos;s Blue Turn</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>We will peacefully gather to stand up to this MAGA regime of bullies for billionaires that is destroying lives and undermining our country. We will demand that ICE be defunded and dismantled as a secret, masked police force that terrorizes people—especially people of color—across the country.  

We will gather to speak the truth and demand accountability and justice for the ongoing pattern of ICE violence and abuse.

We will:  
- Call for ICE to leave our communities  
- Build public pressure  
- Create space for grief, solidarity, and collective action  

We will share Know Your Rights cards, information on how to report ICE activity, and educational leaflet on how ICE has become a building block of authoritarianism so you can spread the word.

Please join us and bring your friends and neighbors. We need to be in the streets, showing how crucial it is that we defend democracy.

<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>St. Mary&apos;s by the Sea Episcopal Church<br>146 12th St<br>Pacific Grove, CA 93950</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Monterey Bay</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>St. Mary&apos;s by the Sea Episcopal Church is partnering with Indivisible Monterey&apos;s WhistleSTOP Campaign to host another Whistlemania in Pacific Grove on Tuesday, February 10, from 5pm to 6:30pm. 

The event, which is free and open to all, gathers volunteers to assemble whistle kits for local community members to alert their neighbors when ICE is nearby. Join us! All ages welcome.

The WhistleSTOP Campaign is inspired by the collective action of thousands of community members in Chicago, Los Angeles, Charlotte and elsewhere who have been using whistles to alert their friends and neighbors when ICE is near or abducting someone.

By literally blowing the whistle on ICE we encourage others to gather and protect community members. Be loud and gather a crowd!

The WhistleSTOP Campaign has a goal of providing 100,000 whistles to local residents to help them alert others when ICE is near. Join us Tuesday, February 10 — together, we can protect our local community.

You can also contribute to these efforts by making a financial gift that will help us buy more whistles. Donate online here: https://onrealm.org/StMarysbytheSea/-/form/give/now</p>

We will not stand by and do nothing while they disappear our community members, leaving nothing but trauma and despair behind. Let&apos;s show everyone in Redwood City and San Mateo County that we stand with our immigrant brothers and sisters in their time of need and we will resist ICE with everything we have.

We&apos;ll meet at Courthouse Square and march through Redwood City. Bring your signs and bring the noise!

This is a peaceful, non-violent protest. We are there to raise awareness, make our voices heard, and have fun. Everything else is none of our business.</p>

<h3>PROTEST ICE BEFORE SUPER BOWL FEB 8TH 11-12:30 RWC El Camino &amp; Jefferson</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Sunday, February 8, 2026 at 7:00 PM UTC - 8:30 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>El Camino and Jefferson Ave<br>1250 Jefferson Ave intersection with El Camino<br>Redwood City, CA 94062</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Portola Valley</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>This will be a protest in Redwood City at El Camino and Jefferson Ave to support all cities--especially Minneapolis--that are standing up to ICE. Honoring those who were killed: Alex Pretti &amp; Renee Good and their families and friends. Another man shot in Arizona on the 27th and currently not named is in critical condition. And 6 who died in immigration detention just since Jan 1st! Honoring others who were arrested illegally and sent to secret jails where their families cannot find them.... There are rumors that ICE is coming to our area during Super Bowl as they want to punish us AND are losing their minds that Bad Bunny is the half time act and will sing in Spanish...so we need to be ready and show our power to stand up. If ICE is here by then we will have updates and more to do. I&apos;ll be updating this information.</p>

<h3>Rally Against The Regime in Roseburg, OR</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 7, 2026 at 8:00 PM UTC - 10:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Sidewalk on NW Stewart Parkway (In Front of Stewart Parkway Medical Building)<br>2460 NW Stewart Pkwy<br>Roseburg, OR 97471</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p># 🛑 RALLY AGAINST THE REGIME

## A Weekly Saturday Protest Against Authoritarianism

**Hosted by:** Indivisible Douglas County

**Date:** Every Saturday (some exceptions for the holidays)

**Time:** 12:00 pm to 2:00 pm

**Location:** 2460 NW Stewart Pkwy, Roseburg, OR 97471 (the sidewalk in front of Stewart Parkway Medical Building, across the street from McDonald&apos;s and Big O Tires)

⸻

## ✊ WHY WE RALLY

This is a weekly, sustained protest against the accelerating rise of authoritarian rule, state violence, and systemic corruption under the Trump administration.

We are rallying to confront:

- The construction of an authoritarian state that uses fear, surveillance, and force to silence dissent

- The mass targeting, criminalization, and disappearance of immigrants and vulnerable citizens carried out by the Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)

- The normalization of corruption, abuse of power, and rule-by-decree governance

- The genocide that continues to this day in Gaza and the West Bank under the ongoing military campaign by Israel against the Palestinian people, aided by the United States

This rally is about one core truth:

- Human rights do not depend on citizenship.

- Human dignity does not stop at borders.

- Democracy cannot survive corruption and terror.

⸻

## 🎯 WHAT WE ARE DEMANDING

We are calling for:

- An end to ICE and DHS being used as political weapons to terrorize our immigrant communities

- The abolition of ICE activity in the United States

- Full protection of due process, asylum rights, and constitutional liberties for all people within our borders

- An end to authoritarian governance, political repression, and state intimidation

- An immediate end to U.S. complicity in Israel’s genocide against the Palestinian people

- Real accountability for corruption, war crimes, and abuse of power—at every level

⸻

## 👥 WHO THIS RALLY IS FOR

- Immigrants, refugees, and their allies

- The Palestinian people and supporters of Palestinian liberation

- Veterans, faith leaders, workers, students, parents, and elders

- Whistleblowers, organizers, human rights defenders

- Anyone who refuses to live under authoritarian rule or corruption by the Trump administration

- Anyone against authoritarianism, fascism, and the abuse of power

- You do not have to be an activist.

- You just have to care about human lives and democratic freedom.

⸻

## 🕊 SAFETY, DISCIPLINE &amp; NONVIOLENCE

This is a peaceful, nonviolent protest, and that means:

- Everyone is responsible for their own de-escalation, as a safety team may not be available for every protest

- Do not take the bait of those who wish to antagonize us or our movement, disengage or remove yourself from conflict

- No physical engagement with counter-protesters

- No weapons of any kind

⸻

## 🪧 WHAT TO BRING

- Signs, banners, flags

- Justice-centered, anti-authoritarian, pro-human-rights messages

- Weather-appropriate clothing

- Water, sunscreen, medication

<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Hillsdale Shopping Center<br>60 31st Ave<br>San Mateo, CA 94403</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> IndivisibleSan Mateo</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Please join Indivisible San Mateo&apos;s Mary Beavins and Rick Moody for conversation and conviviality and a no-host lunch at the Terrace Dining area at Hillsdale Mall in San Mateo on Saturdays, from 11:30 to 12:45 p.m.

The lunch is open to everyone connected with Indivisible San Mateo and will take place prior to our weekly Saturday street protests from 1 to 2:30 p.m., around the corner on El Camino at East 31st Avenue.  On the street, we&apos;ll be enjoying not only the very popular music of The Freedom Strummers but also the company of pro-democracy friends and the cacophonous sounds of solidarity from the passing honking horns.

The Terrace Dining area is on the second floor at the north end of the Mall, accessible by escalator and elevator.  There&apos;s ample parking at the Mall, lots of seating and lots of lunch options for those dining at one of the places in the food court.  The restaurants include Sarku Japan; Tacos E. Grullens; Hakata Kuro Obi Ramen; and Panda Express, among others.  There is also a Haagen-Dazs ice cream shop there.

Reservations are not necessary and all are welcome, whether for lunch or dessert or just fellowship for members of Indivisible San Mateo.  All are encouraged to be part of the rally afterward on El Camino around the corner.</p>

This is a no-host event. An ad hoc group of citizen volunteers are facilitating this opportunity for Marin residents to peacefully and safely assemble in line with their First Amendment rights.

A core principle behind all Marin protest events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values. All participants agree to assume 100% responsibility for their own safety, conduct and well-being.</p>

<h3>Mill Valley #NoICENoWar</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Sunday, February 15, 2026 at 12:00 AM UTC - 1:30 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>47 N Knoll Rd<br>Mill Valley, CA 94941</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> May Day Strong</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Trump is waging war and committing murder to enrich his billionaire backers. We are fighting to stop him. **Stand with us and take action this weekend to demand an end to the occupation of Venezuela and our cities.** 

We’re focusing on corporate targets - companies set to benefit most from the occupation of ICE or Venezuela. 

This week, our target is **Hilton Hotels**, housing this administration&apos;s ICE goons.

**We stand united demanding an end to the Venezuelan occupation and the removal of reckless untrained ICE agents from our communities.** And we&apos;re taking our fight to the companies that are backing this administration and benefiting most.

**Together we will hit these companies in their pocketbooks, force the administration to end the occupation of Venezuela and our cities and spread the word to our neighbors that we deserve better.**

Every dollar spent in wars overseas or at home is a dollar we paid for with our taxes - a dollar that could and should go to helping our communities thrive. We can have good jobs, better schools, access to healthcare and get our basic needs met. But not while our government works for billionaires and not for us.

Join us, stand strong and speak up.

*Please note: A core principle behind all our events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events*</p>

<h3>Tell Target: ICE OUT NOW - Justice for Renee Good &amp; Alex Pretti</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 7, 2026 at 7:00 PM UTC - 9:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Target - Santa Rosa South (public sidewalks)<br>1980 Santa Rosa Ave<br>Santa Rosa, CA 95404</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Sonoma County</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>ICE OUT OF TARGET
Justice for Renee Good and Alex Pretti

Silence is complicity. It’s time to boycott and protest those corporations that comply with the fascist actions of this regime.
 
**Meet on the public sidewalk, north side of Kawana Springs Road at traffic light at the entrance to the Target store parking lot. This is between Santa Rosa Ave and Petaluma Hill Road.**

Protest on sidewalk, bring signs, whistles, and a friend!

*Why Protest Target?*

ICE Staging Locations in MN - It’s alleged that ICE is using Target parking lots to stage their MN operations

Employees are ICE Victims – Some Target employees are being detained, beaten in at least one case, and sent to detention centers 

Corporate cowardice and silence – Target’s corporate headquarters are located in MN. They have said nothing about the lawless actions being perpetrated by ICE in their hometown. (Note: They signed onto a wholly inadequate letter from a MN Business Leadership organization)

Protest Goals – Target needs to publicly oppose immigration activity on its premises, protect employees, and refuse to cooperate with ICE

<h3>Justice for Renée Good / Alex Pretti - ICE out of Home Depot Protest</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Sunday, February 1, 2026 at 7:00 PM UTC - 9:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Bicentennial Way &amp; Mendocino Avenue<br>Santa Rosa, CA 95403</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Sonoma County</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>On Wednesday, January 7th, an American citizen, Renée Good, was killed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Minneapolis, Minnesota. This killing is part of a broader pattern of unchecked violence, impunity, and abuse carried out by federal immigration enforcement agencies against members of our communities.

On August 14, 2025, Roberto Carlos Montoya died during an I.C.E raid in Monrovia, California. He was struck by a car and killed while being pursued by I.C.E. Almost immediately, DHS released a dishonest press release denying responsibility for Roberto&apos;s death. This is the second documented death during an I.C.E. raid. There have been numerous protests at Home Depot locations across Southern California. Now in solidarity, protests will begin at Home Depot locations in Northern California.

A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.

Rain cancels and no event on holiday weekends.</p>

People classified as &quot;migrants&quot; are in the eye of the fascist storm sweeping across the world. As Trump tries to put a tyrannical, authoritarian regime in place, ICE has sent out plainclothed, masked gunmen to grab our neighbors, co-workers, and friends and disappear them into private, for-profit immigration jails. Children are being torn away from their parents - again. Migrants are being deported to random countries, paid by Trump to warehouse them. What is being done to migrants today is rapidly spreading to affect those of us classified as citizens. We must reject Trump&apos;s efforts to divide citizens from migrants. We do that by acting in solidarity and crushing Trump&apos;s ICE machine.</p>

## Defend Immigrants and Our Communities

IEB is working with Street Level Health Project and the Immigrant Defense Committee in Fruitvale to support Adopt a Day Labor Corner.  

Now is the time to show up for our neighbors by joining IEB&apos;s Adopt a Corner Team at Home Depot in Oakland. We provide you with training and orientation and we ask you to volunteer one 2-hour shift per week.  

ICE has been conducting raids at Home Depot stores across the country. Day laborers are the most vulnerable immigrants, risking their freedom to look for work and feed their families. 

Showing up for Adopt a Day Labor Corner is an important and challenging opportunity to support immigrants who risk ICE abductions, deportation and family separation.  Our presence at Home Depot can make a difference.

        <name>PETITION: Stop Secret Deportations and Stand for Due Process in America</name>
        <description><![CDATA[
<h3>PETITION: Stop Secret Deportations and Stand for Due Process in America</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, May 17, 2025 at 4:00 AM UTC - 4:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Mississippi Democratic Party</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>They say this is the land of the free—but in today’s America, people are being taken from their homes and communities without warning, without a lawyer, and without even a phone call.

Right now, under this administration, ICE agents are rounding up men, women, and even children—some of them U.S. citizens—without proper identification, without cause, and without any concern for our rights as Americans. 

They’re skipping courts. They’re skipping judges. They’re putting people on planes and shipping them out like they don’t matter.

This isn’t law and order. This is government overreach. And it’s not how things are supposed to work in a country that calls itself free.

We know what it’s like down here in Mississippi. We know what it feels like to be ignored, mistreated, and pushed to the side. Now ICE is doing the same to our neighbors, our church members, our coworkers, and our friends.

Nobody should be dragged off in the night with no hearing, no lawyer, no phone call.

Whether someone’s lived here ten years or ten generations, they deserve a fair shot. That’s just basic justice—and the kind of freedom our country is supposed to stand for.

Sign this petition and tell our elected leaders:

We want ICE held accountable. We want due process respected. And we won’t stand for secret deportations in our communities.

This is our home, and we’re not letting fear take it from us.</p>

<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> We Are California</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>When ICE agents came for our neighbors, families, and friends on June 6th -- armed like they were at war -- they brought terror into our schools, neighborhoods, and workplaces.

Millions have shared critical Know Your Rights Information online, and thousands have taken to the streets in protest. Now, we need YOUR help to bring critical Know Your Rights information to homes across Los Angeles by dropping off door hangers to our neighbors and community members.

Can you or your organization help us protect our loved ones and neighbors?  Sign up to give out Know Your Rights door hangers in your community today.

Also, sign up for an upcoming virtual training on Thu, Feb. 12 6:30-8pm on Know Your Rights and how to coordinate your own door hanger drop in your neighborhood: https://www.mobilize.us/millionvotersproject/event/895110/

Note: When signing up, please include your phone number.  An organizer will call you directly to coordinate!</p>

        <name>ICE OUT OF ATX - Demand APD stop collaborating with ICE &amp; DHS</name>
        <description><![CDATA[
<h3>ICE OUT OF ATX - Demand APD stop collaborating with ICE &amp; DHS</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Wednesday, January 14, 2026 at 6:00 AM UTC - 6:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Hands Off Central TX - Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>We, undersigned, **call on the City of Austin to protect Austin residents from the violence of ICE and DHS** by immediately prohibiting the Austin Police Department from supporting any attempt by ICE or DPS to question, detain, and deport Austin residents and visitors.

We condemn the Austin Police Department&apos;s continued cooperation with federal law enforcement agencies who verifiably and repeatedly violate people’s constitutional rights, operate outside of their jurisdiction, and ignore due process.

We call on Austin City Council, Mayor Kirk Watson, and City Manager T.C. Broadnax to **immediately pass a city ordinance that prevents any APD employee from helping immigration agents** serving administrative warrants to Austin residents, including but not limited to:

Running a warrant check for ICE/DHS administrative warrants

- Serving ICE/DHS administrative warrants

- Detaining people on behalf of ICE/DHS

- Handing people over to ICE/DHS who are in APD custody

- Alerting these ICE/DHS to the location of Austin residents and visitors

We call on Austin Police Chief Lisa Davis to immediately **retrain the entire APD staff** to prevent city employees from knowingly or unknowingly notifying ICE of the residency address or current location of Austinites with ICE/DPS administrative warrants.

Austin Police Department’s assistance to ICE and DPS is quickly eroding the remaining trust Austinites have in our local government and local law enforcement. 

ICE and Border Patrol have **consistently escalated harm against civilians across the United States.** Here in Austin, they are racially profiling our communities, stopping Austin drivers without cause, and detaining and deporting our neighbors without due process.

Last week, the Austin Police Department responded to a 911 call. The department ran a warrant check for the women who had called them, which turned up an administrative immigration warrant. As a result, an **Austin mother and her child, who is a U.S. citizen, were taken into custody by federal immigration officials,** not allowed to share the details of their detainment with their family or local advocacy organizations, and deported even though the child is an American citizen.

This is only one of many stories from APD collaboration with federal immigration authorities.

If the City of Austin wants to claim that **our police department exists to serve and protect** our residents, the city should provide full transparency around the actions and policies of city employees, if city employees are even tangentially involved, when our neighbors go missing from their homes and workplaces.

APD in any way facilitating the detainment of Austin residents by any federal immigration department significantly impacts safety in our community by making it **less likely that immigrants, undocumented people, people of color, and anyone associated with the anti-ICE movement will report crimes** or cooperate with local law enforcement.

Immigration agents are increasing their violence and harassment of American residents, including undocumented immigrants, immigrants on valid visas, protestors, journalists, first responders, doctors, lawyers, bystanders, and legal observers. They have released chemical weapons into vehicles and on school property. They flagrantly and repeatedly violate their own use of force guidelines, act outside of their jurisdiction, and ignore due process altogether.

These agents and their lawlessness pose a significant bodily threat to the safety of every Austinite, and **we demand that the City of Austin act with expediency to prevent further detainment and deportations due to the actions of city employees.**

We demand city guarantees that the department is refusing to search for and serve ICE and DHS warrants, and new APD policies that materially protect Austin residents and visitors from ICE and DHS violence.</p>

<h3>Gather Your Neighbors: Host a Potluck About Minneapolis &amp; What to Do About It!</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, January 20, 2026 at 8:00 AM UTC - 8:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Showing Up for Racial Justice</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>## We need to get organized – so organize your neighbors!

### Host a potluck with your friends, family, or neighbors to talk about what&apos;s happening and how to fight back against ICE. 
...............................................................................

One of the most important lessons we&apos;ve learned from Minneapolis is that forming connections, before things went down, was critical to community defense. So let&apos;s form those relationships!

We are asking folks to think of at least 3 people to bring together for a potluck, for coffee, or for a gathering, this weekend, to talk about what&apos;s been happening in Minneapolis, process together, and identify some concrete next steps for what to do about it. This is the first step to getting your community organized, and being able to fight back against ICE in the long haul. 

Are you in? Sign this commitment form if you&apos;re down, then follow the steps in our [toolkit!](https://act.surj.org/a/iceoutpotluck)


...............................................................................

_Showing Up For Racial Justice (SURJ) is the largest organization that explicitly organizes white people towards racial and economic justice - all are welcome to do our work with us. For more info, visit [surj.org](https://surj.org/)._</p>

<h3>Take Action Now To Save Lives From ICE</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, January 24, 2026 at 5:00 AM UTC - 5:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> MoveOn</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Alex Jeffrey Pretti, Renee Nicole Good, Keith Porter, and many, many others have now been executed by President Trump’s ICE. The administration is murdering people in the streets for peacefully protesting to protect their neighbors and children. It’s heartbreaking and horrifying. Yet in the face of ICE’s brutality, Minnesotans aren’t giving up, they’re showing up. 

In freezing temperatures, tens of thousands of Minnesotans are taking the streets, delivering groceries to immigrant families, and joining together in community. Minnesota is leading the way, and MoveOn is coming together to stand with them.

Sign the pledge to take action against ICE, and be in solidarity with Minnesotans, and we&apos;ll be in touch with next steps.</p>

<h3>South Asians Demand an Immediate End to Lawless ICE Violence</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Sunday, February 1, 2026 at 6:00 AM UTC - 4:59 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> SAAVE Texas</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>This is no longer political. It is a constitutional and moral crisis.
SAMPLE SCRIPT 

Hi, my name is [NAME], and I’m a South Asian constituent from [CITY, ZIP].

I’m calling because I am deeply concerned about the direction of this country. This is no longer politics — it is a moral, ethical, and constitutional crisis.

We have now witnessed two Americans, Renee Good and Alex Pretti, shot and killed by federal immigration agents, while countless others are dying in detention without ever having their day in court.

Armed, often unidentified agents are approaching South Asian families without warrants, without transparency, and without accountability. The line between constitutional law and unchecked force is being erased.

We demand that you act immediately to stop ICE’s lawless violence, defend constitutional protections, and refuse to fund abuse.

Texas is home to one of the largest South Asian populations in the country, and our communities are watching closely.

I demand that Senator Cornyn oppose any funding that expands ICE and push for immediate accountability and strict constitutional limits on enforcement.

OTHER DETAILS TO SHARE 
Congress must stop ICE now and defend the Constitution
South Asian communities are in deep fear and alarm as armed, often unidentified agents approach families without warrants, without transparency, and without accountability. The line between lawful enforcement and unchecked violence is being erased, and constitutional protections are being dangerously blurred.

We have now witnessed two Americans shot and killed by federal immigration agents, while countless others have died in detention without ever having their day in court. This breakdown of due process and rule of law threatens every community.

Texas is home to one of the largest South Asian populations in the country, and our families are watching closely.

We demand immediate action to stop ICE’s lawless violence, defend constitutional rights, and refuse to fund abuse.

Join us in calling Senators Cruz and Cornyn to demand accountability, constitutional protections, and an end to this crisis.</p>

<h3>Sick about ICE Terrorism? Let’s call our elected officials. Mondays, 12PM PST</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Monday, February 2, 2026 at 8:00 PM UTC - 8:30 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> CBFD Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Are you upset about the dismantling of our democracy, the violence perpetrated by I.C.E. on innocent people, the theft of millions of Americans’ private information, attacks on healthcare and social security, the Republican intent to take away a woman’s right to vote, and more? Don’t despair - take action!

One easy thing you can do that truly matters is make calls to your elected representatives, to let them know how you feel about an issue and what you expect them to do about it. Maybe you want to call your Member of Congress or your Senators but just haven’t done it yet. You know what you want, but you aren’t sure what to say.

Well, we’ve got a solution - a tool to help you make the calls, and to make your point. It’s also very rewarding because we’re doing it together. Join us every Monday on Zoom beginning January 5, 2026 at Noon Pacific time. We’ll provide all you need to make the calls - phone numbers, scripts, and training.  You’ll just need your phone, or your phone and your computer if you’d like a bigger screen for viewing.
 
We hope to see you on Zoom for this easy, effective action. Thirty minutes is all you’ll need to make sure our electeds know that we’re paying attention and demanding they take action.  There are millions of us across America - our collective voices will make a difference.  We’re in this together!</p>

<h3>Statewide Organizing Working Group</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Monday, February 2, 2026 at 11:00 PM UTC - 12:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> New York Working Families Party</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>From Onondaga County to New York City, the Working Families Party secured historic electoral wins this November -- and now the work has only just begun. The Trump Administration has slashed funding for critical services like SNAP and Medicaid, dumped millions of tax payer dollars into ICE, and is gearing up to cut more and more from our budget. New York State has the power and responsibility to STEP UP during the 2026 state budget and make the ultra wealthy pay their fare share so that we can fund the programs and services that allow NYers to thrive. Universal childcare, affordable housing, a true living wage, affordable and accessible healthcare are all possible and on the horizon for NYS. 

But we need YOU 🫵 to win.

Join us on Mondays at 6pm from January through April to build statewide power and directly contribute to NY WFP&apos;s strategy to advance policies that address the deep rooted economic inequalities in our state. 

Come ready to: lead virtual/in-person field events, sharpen your strategic decision making skills, deepen our collective political education, and meet likeminded volunteers across NYS.

NO PRIOR EXPERIENCE NECESSARY!</p>

<h3>ICE OUT For Good Indivisible Phone Bank</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, February 3, 2026 at 8:00 PM UTC - 10:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Masked federal agents are terrorizing our communities. They’re teargassing babies, kidnapping our neighbors, shooting clergy in the face with chemical projectiles, and killing innocent people.

**But right now, we have an opportunity to rein in ICE at the federal level.** ICE and Border Patrol are part of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). DHS funding expires at midnight on Friday, Jan. 30. Congress is currently negotiating how to fund DHS moving forward. Democrats met our first demand that DHS cannot be funded business as usual, and now we need Republicans to join them in finding the political will to meet this moment. This is our opportunity to put significant restrictions on ICE and ensure it doesn’t get a single penny more to enable its brutality.

**Join us on Tuesday, February 3, at 3 p.m. EST** to call voters in key states and encourage them to call their Republican senators to demand that they rein in ICE’s terror tactics.

<h3>Phone Bank for People&apos;s Champion Analilia Mejìa!</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, February 3, 2026 at 11:00 PM UTC - 2:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Showing Up for Racial Justice</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>## Come phone bank with SURJ!  
We&apos;ll be calling to **elect people’s champion Analilia Mejìa** who is running to represent New Jersey&apos;s 11th Congressional District.

Come as you are!  No experience needed!  Full training &amp; *lots* of support included!

......................................

## Logistics:
- These phone banks are online on the Zoom platform. Log into the call on Zoom on your computer and bring your phone to make the calls (if you only have one device, still come!). 
- We have a robust training on the call to give you all the information you need-- a script, technical support, and coaching throughout.
- Returners can start early. 
- You will receive an email with orientation materials ahead of time.
- ***Please note the time zone for call time***. 

......................................

## Feeling Unsure?

- **Our model works** - learn from the best! Our phone banks have one of the highest rates of success in the country. No matter whether you&apos;re a brand new caller or a seasoned organizer, if you join our banks, you can trust that you are putting your effort into a method that works. And you&apos;ll get to learn powerful organizing skills from seasoned leaders! 
- Our conversations are based on **open-ended questions** and **deep listening.** **You do not need to be an expert** on the issues or a candidate - our phone banks are successful because we deeply connect with voters and make them feel heard.
- Want to hear what a phonebank is like? Check out [**this video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3w4tNKPTY8) interviewing SURJ phonebankers.

......................................

## Context:

We are living in a historic time of the consolidation of authoritarian, billionaire-funded power in this country. At the same time, at every turn, **regular people have risen up, fought back**, and set a vision for what working people deserve: affordable healthcare, good schools, the right to live in our communities without fear. Since Trump’s election, **SURJ has been a part of meeting this moment**, from training thousands of white people in strategic noncompliance to fight ICE raids to recruiting thousands of newly-activated people into our movement. 

As they defund the social safety net and peddle more racist lies, millions of people are increasingly feeling the effects of the billionaire agenda. We know this fight is on multiple fronts, and **in 2026 we have an opportunity to harness the energy of the streets** – to not only wrest power from MAGA, but to ***put candidates in office who are willing to stand up to Trump and fight for working class people.***

This race will affect thousands of working class people and help set the tone going into the **2026 midterms**. Alongside our partners across the country, this is the time for our movements to offer a bold vision and bring our people into it.

......................................

Four Central Texas Indivisible chapters have come together to support the Central Texas Food Bank. Your contribution here helps ensure that families facing hunger have what they need, and that no one in our community is left behind. With the loss of funding for SNAP and many other important programs, these efforts are more important than ever.

And it doesn&apos;t stop here. We&apos;re encouraging our members, family, and friends to also give the gift of time and volunteer to help ensure these resources reach those who need it most.

<h3>The Flip List: 2026 Strategy Session with Brady Quirk-Garvan</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Wednesday, February 4, 2026 at 11:00 PM UTC - 12:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Charleston County Democratic Party</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Another boring Zoom? Absolutely not. 👀

The Charleston County Democratic Party is hosting a virtual strategy session with political strategist Brady Quirk-Garvan to break down which local seats are flippable in 2026 and what we can do to actually flip them. 

We’re talking real, local, specific analysis of:

📍 Flippable Charleston-area seats (with names, maps, and math)

🗺️ Where Democrats are already closer than most people realize

📊 What races you should prioritize and how we turn out voters and support our candidates

If you care about Charleston being a place where you can afford to live, the marsh still exists, your rights aren’t a seasonal debate topic, your libraries aren’t censored, your neighborhood survives climate change, and ICE isn’t roaming the streets, you need to be here. 

The midterms start now. Pull up.

Note: This event is a virtual meeting and the link will be provided via email after registration.</p>

<h3>Public School Strong Organizing Meeting</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Wednesday, February 11, 2026 at 12:00 AM UTC - 1:30 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Public School Strong</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>**Over the past weeks and months, we&apos;ve seen the parents of public school kids harassed, abducted and deported on their way to pick their kids up from school.  We&apos;ve seen ICE pepper spray high school students and arrest educators on school grounds.  We&apos;re seeing proposed bills in states like Tennessee to use public schools to target immigrant families for deportation.**

**We&apos;ve also seen incredible bravery, solidarity and resilience on the part of students, parents, educators, and community members who have gone above and beyond to support and defend each other in the face of these federal invasions.**

We all have much to learn from those who have experienced these ICE surges, in cities like Durham, NC, Chicago, IL and Minneapolis, MN.

**Join us for the next Public Schools Strong organizing meeting on Tue, 2/10 to learn from leaders on the ground and get tools to protect your community and schools .**  

Public School Strong Organizing Meetings are a space for  parents, family members, educators, and public education supporters from across the nation gather each month to gain practical tools to promote, protect, and strengthen our public schools.

*If you have already attended a Public School Strong Orientation, you&apos;ll join a breakout room with current members for connection, reflection and training. If you&apos;re new, we&apos;ve got you covered too!*

### Join public school families, educators and supporters from across the country to learn how to:
1. Form a Public School Strong team in your school district
2. Engage your community to get school boards and district leaders to speak up for equitable and fully funded public schools
3. Connect your local advocacy to others for state and national impact

For more info, please visit publicschoolstrong.org

### Current Public School Strong Members

There is strength in staying connected. After completing Public School Strong (PSS) Orientation, this is your consistent space to reconnect with your peers across the country to:

1. Access helpful tools and practice relevant skills,
2. Connect the dots between what is happening locally and nationally,
3. Learn from mistakes and progress made along the way

Bring a friend!

<h3>Lunchtime Meeting w/ Sen. Cantwell&apos;s Staff</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Wednesday, February 11, 2026 at 9:00 PM UTC - 9:45 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Seattle Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p># Join Seattle Indivisible for a Critical Discussion with Senator Cantwell&apos;s Staff

Join Seattle Indivisible for an engaging Zoom discussion and Q&amp;A session with staff from Senator Maria Cantwell&apos;s office. As we navigate a complex political landscape in 2025, several key issues demand our attention:

Key Issues in 2026
🧊 Paramilitary Forces Attacking Immigrants and our Cities
ICE and CPB waging illegal, violent campaigns against immigrants and Black and brown people. 


🏛️ Constitutional Concerns
The ongoing failure of institutions to protect our rights and programs established by Congress have raised serious questions about the erosion of democratic principles.

💰 Economic Uncertainty
The imposition of a federal spending freeze has led to confusion and legal challenges, impacting various programs and contributing to fiscal instability.

⚖️ Social Equity
Policies targeting marginalized communities, including restrictions on transgender rights and potential cuts to social safety nets, underscore the ongoing struggle for social justice.

Senator Cantwell has been a vocal advocate for protecting democratic institutions, promoting economic stability, and advancing social equity. This session offers a unique opportunity to engage directly with her staff on these pressing issues.

📢 Your participation is crucial in voicing concerns and influencing decisions that impact our community.

We look forward to your active involvement in shaping the future of our state and nation!</p>

<h3>Squad Up and Distribute Know Your Rights Door Hangers!</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Friday, February 13, 2026 at 2:30 AM UTC - 4:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> We Are California</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>*When signing up, please include your phone number so we can reach out to you about the training!*

Last year, ICE agents came for our neighbors, families, and friends, armed like they were at war. They brought terror into our schools, neighborhoods, and workplaces -- and we responded the way Angelenos and Californians always do: by standing up for each other. Hundreds of community members passed out thousands of Know Your Rights door hangers in your neighborhoods and at local businesses!

Now, after witnessing the intense escalation of violence by ICE agents at the start of 2026, it is more urgent than ever to prepare ourselves with knowledge, care, and a collective plan of how we will show up for our community.  

We Are California Squads need YOUR help to bring critical Know Your Rights information to homes across Los Angeles by dropping off door hangers to our neighbors and community members. Join this training to learn more about your rights, your risks, and how to share the knowledge in your neighborhood!

Join us to Squad Up and Throw Down for our community!</p>

JAN: Here Comes the Sun
By Bill McKibben

FEB:  A Future We Can Love 
By Susan Bauer-Wu 
Available on Amazon paperback + free audio book with Audible membership

Inspired by a conversation between the Dalai Lama and Greta Thunberg spoke for the first time in January 2021, millions of people around the world took notice. This book captures the lessons that came from that interaction. 


MAR: The Fragile Earth
By David Remnick, Henry Finder

A collection of essays that tell the story of climate change—its past, present, and future—taking readers from Greenland to the Great Plains, and into both laboratories and rain forests.

APR: The Genius of Earth Day
By Adam Rome
Available at local library, Hoopla, Amazon + free audiobook with Audible membership.

The story of the first Earth Day is inspiring: it had a power, a freshness, and a seriousness of purpose that are difficult to imagine today. Earth Day 1970 created an entire green generation. 

MAY:  Amplify
By Adam Met 
Available on Amazon in paperback or Audible audio book

A musician and member of the multiplatinum band AJR, Adam Met is also a climate advocate and educator, who shows how to apply fan-building strategies to social movements in exciting, inventive ways. Amplify is a playbook for developing passionate supporters utilizing the art and science of engagement, collaboration, and authentic connection, with tactics that will inspire people to carry a climate message to the world and spur others to act.

JUN: Unsettled 
by Steven Koonin 
Available at the local library, on Hoopla and Amazon Paperback or Audible audio book

Koonin was the top science advisor to the Obama administration.  When it comes to climate change, the media, politicians, and other prominent voices have declared that “the science is settled.” In reality, the climate is changing, but the why and how aren’t as clear as you’ve probably been led to believe. Koonin takes listeners behind the headlines, dispels popular myths, and unveils little-known truths. 

JUL: Documentary:  Ice on Fire
Free on Youtube (1:37)
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP2IE8Upehc) 
Narrated by Leonardo DiCaprio

&quot;Ice on Fire&quot; explores the many ways we reduce carbon inputs to the atmosphere and, more importantly, how to &quot;draw&quot; carbon down, bringing CO2 out of the atmosphere and thus paving the way for global temperatures to go down. Through visiting visionaries and scientists young and old, the film explores the deep hope that we can turn away from the brink.  

AUG: Running Out 
By Lucas Bessire
Available at the local library, on Hoopla and Amazon Paperback

The imminent depletion of the Ogallala and other aquifers around the world is a defining planetary crisis of our times. Running Out explores aquifer depletion and the deeper layers through which it gains meaning and force. Anthropologist Lucas Bessire journeyed back to Western Kansas, where five generations of his family lived as irrigation farmers and ranchers, to try to make sense of this vital resource and its loss.

SEPT: Half Earth 
By Edward O. Wilson 
Available at the local library, on Hoopla and Amazon Paperback + Audiobook

In order to stave off the mass extinction of species, including our own, we must move swiftly to preserve the biodiversity of our planet. In this &quot;visionary blueprint for saving the planet&quot; (Stephen Greenblatt), Half-Earth argues that the situation facing us is too large to be solved piecemeal and proposes a solution commensurate with the magnitude of the problem: dedicate fully half the surface of the Earth to nature. 

OCT: The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind (watch the movie or read the book)
Movie: Find it on Youtube or Netflix 
Book: Available at the local library, on Hoopla and Amazon Paperback + Audiobook

Born to a family of farmers, Malawian agricultural engineer William Kamkwamba made headlines in 2001 when he built a functioning windmill out of old bicycle parts and scraps. (At the time, he was just 14 years old.) The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind, based on Kamkwamba’s memoir of the same name, tells the amazing true story of how he built a wind turbine and saved his small farming village from famine.

NOV: The Talking Earth (young adult)
by Jean George 
Available at the local library, on Hoopla and Amazon Paperback + Audiobook

Billie is a member of the Seminole Tribe, in a quest to identify facts over legend, she goes out into the Everglades alone, to stay until she can believe. In the wilderness, she discovers that she must listen to the land and animals in order to survive. With an otter, a panther cub, and a turtle as companions and guides, she begins to understand that the world of her people can give her the answers she seeks.

        <name>Urge Your City Council to SHUT DOWN Flock</name>
        <description><![CDATA[
<h3>Urge Your City Council to SHUT DOWN Flock</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 14, 2026 at 5:30 PM UTC - 5:30 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Southend Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>THIS EVENT IS NOW AND ONGOING (ignore posted date/time)

With the first city council meetings of 2026 beginning, right now is a critical opportunity to urge your council to protect their constituents from Trump&apos;s ICE goons. 

ALPR (Automated License Plate Reader) cameras - i.e. Flock and Axon - have been widely reported by local and national media as being used - often secretly - by ICE to collect data meant only for local police departments. A UW study unveiled that ICE accessed Flock data​​ in at least 18 WA cities: jsis.washington.edu/humanrights/2025/10/21/leaving-the-door-wide-open

It&apos;s now clear these cameras give ICE a powerful surveillance tool to kidnap our neighbors, making all of us LESS safe.

Email your city council with a simple ask: &quot;Shut down ALPR cameras.&quot;

<h3>Talk to our Neighbors about ICE: Phone Bank with SURJ!</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, February 17, 2026 at 11:00 PM UTC - 2:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Showing Up for Racial Justice</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>#### Right now is the time to intervene.  To step up.  To move our people.

As the Trump Administration continues to deploy violent ICE agents to our nation&apos;s cities, we remain clear and centered on the following truths:

1. White working class Americans have so much to gain by standing in solidarity with our immigrant neighbors.
2. Trump’s aggressive and violent deployment of ICE is causing many white working class communities to re-evaluate their views and beliefs on immigration.
3. Listening-forward conversations that support people to reflect on their values, feelings and experiences can shift their attitudes, perspective and behavior.

That&apos;s why we&apos;re channeling these truths into a powerful action that you can take with us.

**Join SURJ to talk to key white working class voters about their feelings on Trump’s immigration policies and deployment of ICE in the key congressional districts  that will determine control of the House in the 2026 elections.**

Together, we can move the needle and build power.  No prior experience needed – we’ll provide all the resources,  training and support you need to phone bank with us to have these critical conversations at a critical juncture for shaping public opinion and our society’s commonsense beliefs around immigration policy</p>

<h3>Conozca Sus Derechos (Know Your Rights, Spanish)</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Thursday, February 19, 2026 at 11:00 PM UTC - 12:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> State Voices Florida</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p># ¡TODOS TENEMOS DERECHOS!

## Seas ciudadano o no, la ley te protege.

Únete a nosotros el **18 de Septiembre** a las **6PM EST** en una capacitación gratuita para:

- Conocer tus derechos frente a oficiales de inmigración (en casa, en la calle o en un vehículo).
- Aprender cómo protegerte y preparar a tu familia.
- Informarte sobre las nuevas leyes en Florida que afectan a nuestra comunidad.

 En Florida, todos los condados firmaron _acuerdos 287(g)_ con ICE, lo que significa que la policía local puede actuar como agentes de inmigración incluso en paradas de tráfico. Además, nuevas leyes aumentan las penas contra inmigrantes y limitan el acceso a la educación para estudiantes indocumentados.

Pero no estamos solos. Al informarnos y compartir este conocimiento, podemos cuidarnos entre todos.

En este taller recibirás una Guía de Conozca Sus Derechos (KYR) clara y práctica para protegerte y apoyar a tu comunidad.</p>

<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p># Join Seattle Indivisible for a Critical Discussion with Senator Cantwell&apos;s Staff

Join Seattle Indivisible for an engaging Zoom discussion and Q&amp;A session with staff from Senator Maria Cantwell&apos;s office. As we navigate a complex political landscape in 2025, several key issues demand our attention:

Key Issues in 2026
🧊 Paramilitary Forces Attacking Immigrants and our Cities
ICE and CPB waging illegal, violent campaigns against immigrants and Black and brown people. 


🏛️ Constitutional Concerns
The ongoing failure of institutions to protect our rights and programs established by Congress have raised serious questions about the erosion of democratic principles.

💰 Economic Uncertainty
The imposition of a federal spending freeze has led to confusion and legal challenges, impacting various programs and contributing to fiscal instability.

⚖️ Social Equity
Policies targeting marginalized communities, including restrictions on transgender rights and potential cuts to social safety nets, underscore the ongoing struggle for social justice.

Senator Cantwell has been a vocal advocate for protecting democratic institutions, promoting economic stability, and advancing social equity. This session offers a unique opportunity to engage directly with her staff on these pressing issues.

📢 Your participation is crucial in voicing concerns and influencing decisions that impact our community.

We look forward to your active involvement in shaping the future of our state and nation!</p>
