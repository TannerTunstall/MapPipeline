<h3>Fight for Democracy - Out with ICE  [Tysons VA]</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, January 31, 2026 at 4:00 PM UTC - 5:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Westpark Dr and Route 7<br>Gosnell Rd<br>Tysons, VA 22102</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Third Act and Indivisible are grassroots groups in all 50 states that believe in the possibility of change and are doing the work to make it happen.  We believe that we, the people, through our members, and along with many other organizations, and with millions of residents, can turn around the current march towards autocracy. BUT ONLY WITH YOUR HELP.

Here in Northern Virginia, we are not staying silent in the face of the attack on every institution and every racial, ethnic, and religious group in this country except those of the elites (you know who we mean).   When everything is under attack, what do we do?  Stand up and fight back.  Stand up and fight back against hatred, bigotry, racism, xenophobia, homophobia, misogyny, and antisemitism.   Stand up and fight back against the attacks on NIH, CDC, EPA, NPS, DOE, DOJ, CFPB, SSA, USAID, the Fed, universities, and law firms.  Stand up and fight back against the federal invasion of our cities and the kidnapping of hard-working, tax paying, loyal immigrants looking for a better way of life. Out with ICE!   And we do not forget about our felllow citizens of the world - the continuing and unending genocide in Gaza supported by US arms,  the unprovoked atrocities in Ukraine not defended by US arms, and the mind-numbing degree of starvation and disease in Africa caused by the cruel policy to take away the US AID humanitarian  mission.

Our Putin-loving president is in the process of taking away all of our constitutional rights and trying to take away our humanity.  STAND UP AGAINST IT ALL.  Come out with signs, banners, horns, whistles, pots and pans - whatever you can think of to get the attention of your fellow citizens who are passing by and may not be as focused as they should be on the desperate state of our democracy.  

Stand up for the Constitution for the Rule of Law.  Stand up for Humanity.

This is not the time to sit on the sidelines. This is a time for action!

This a local Indivisible event!

*A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*</p>

<h3>ICE Out For Good - Sherman Circle</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Sunday, February 1, 2026 at 8:00 PM UTC - 9:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>3700 Georgia Ave NW<br>Washington, DC 20010</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Wednesday, January 7th, an American citizen was killed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Minneapolis, Minnesota. This killing is part of a broader pattern of unchecked violence, impunity, and abuse carried out by federal immigration enforcement agencies against members of our communities. 

A broad coalition of groups across the country is calling for a coordinated Ice Out For Good Weekend of Action on Saturday, January 10th and Sunday, January 11th to demand accountability, honor the life lost, and make visible the human cost of ICE’s actions. 

A core principle behind all ICE Out For Good events is a commitment to nonviolent action and no civil disobedience. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values, and to act lawfully at these events. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events. All events should be held in public spaces or on public property.

Indivisible is managing data and communications with participants. By registering, you agree to receive info from Indivisible about the event, receive communications via e-mail or SMS message from Indivisible, and receive any other updates and opportunities to take action or support ICE OUT FOR GOOD partner organizations. You also agree to have any data entered in this registration collected by Indivisible. Indivisible will treat your data according to our organization’s applicable privacy policy: https://indivisible.org/privacy-policy</p>

<h3>Olney Stands Up for Democracy</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Thursday, February 5, 2026 at 10:00 PM UTC - 11:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Georgia Avenue &amp; Maryland 108<br>Olney, MD 20832</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>We stand with our neighbors for democracy, for justice, and for an economy that works for all of us, not just billionaires. We stand for science, the rule of law, a working government, kindness and common decency.

We stand on the streets so people who are fearful know they are not alone. We protest to remind ourselves that this is not normal. This is not what generations of Americans have fought and died for; we stand in the streets to honor their legacy.

We oppose fascism, tyranny, the lawless cruelty of ICE, the epic corruption, the reckless attacks on science, the idiotic tariffs, and we call out the spineless elected officials who are bending their knees to a clown who thinks only of himself.

Our protests give courage to everyone else who takes a stand. We won&apos;t back down to a clown. And when that clown goes down, we will mourn all that we have lost, and then we will rebuild on a firmer foundation. Together.

Come for your own reasons, bring your own signs or borrow one. Bring your own light or borrow one. Bring your own sounds, or dance to the protest playlist we have.

It&apos;s going to be dark and cold at 5:00, so dress warmly and maybe bring a booklight to illuminate your protest sign. To keep us all safe, we will cancel if the temperatures are below freezing, or when it rains, sleets, or snows. This is a marathon.

<h3>ICE Out For Good: week of calls</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Friday, January 30, 2026 at 5:00 AM UTC - 5:00 PM</p>

<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>This a local Indivisible event!

Rein in ICE for Good Week of Calls Campaign

Suggested topics:

- Priority1: Call your Senators and urge them to vote “No” on the reconciliation bill H.R.7147 giving DHS, ICE and CBP more money. Tell them which programs you’d like to see your money go to.

- Priority2: Call Chuck Schumer’s office in DC (202) 224-6542, speak to him as the Democratic Minority Leader and demand he unify his party against the upcoming DHS funding bill H.R.7147. They will be voting on it this week.

- H.Res 996, articles of impeachment against Kristi Noem – follow up from last week. Call or email; ask “Why haven’t you cosponsored the impeachment of Kristi Noem, yet?” and let them know you would like a written response. Check if your Rep is on the list here: https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-resolution/996/cosponsors

- Be sure to thank representatives who are cosponsors of H.Res.996!

- Demand enforcement of restrictions on DHS authority in states – Ask them “what ever happened to State’s rights?” if you have a Republican elected official. Request a written response.

Hi, my name is [NAME] and I’m a constituent from [CITY, ZIP]. (Leave full address if leaving a voicemail).

I’m calling to demand [REP/SEN NAME] stand up against DHS and their outrageous human rights violations. As your constituent, I demand that you [Insert Topic and Personal Relevance].

Thank you for your time and consideration.

<h3>Progressive Maryland&apos;s Lobby Night 2026</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Monday, February 23, 2026 at 9:15 PM UTC - 12:45 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>199 Duke of Gloucester St<br>Annapolis, MD 21401</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Progressive Maryland</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Join us for Progressive Maryland&apos;s 2026 Lobby Night as we come together in Annapolis to make our voices heard! This is your chance to meet with legislators from your district and advocate for bold, transformative policies that support working families across Maryland.

We know speaking with lawmakers can feel daunting, so we&apos;ll provide a comprehensive prep session beforehand to ensure you feel confident and comfortable. You&apos;ll learn about our key priority bills, how to share your story effectively, and tips for making a lasting impact during your conversations.

Legislators don&apos;t often hear directly from the community members their policies affect the most. That’s why your voice is so important. By showing up and sharing your experiences, you&apos;ll remind them that Marylanders demand bold action and leadership.

We&apos;ll be focusing on our key priority bills:

🌱 Advancing environmental justice to ensure healthy communities and combat climate change.

🌎 Winning stronger protections for Marylanders from abuses by ICE and other federal immigration agencies.

💰 Closing corporate tax loopholes, raising wages, and strengthening worker protections.

❤️‍🩹 Reforming healthcare to prioritize care over costs and put Marylanders&apos; well-being first.

Your voice is powerful, and when we come together, we can push for the change our state needs. Whether you&apos;re new to advocacy or a seasoned activist, Lobby Night is the perfect opportunity to take action and build relationships with our lawmakers.

Let’s show our legislators that Marylanders demand justice, equity, and bold leadership! RSVP today to join us in shaping a brighter future for our communities.</p>

Thank you!



ICE is [expanding its operations in Baltimore](https://www.wmar2news.com/infocus/federal-contract-bids-show-ice-planning-to-expand-operations-in-maryland-during-immigration-crackdown) and we need our local leaders to do everything they can to protect the rights and safety of our immigrant neighbors! 

Act now to make sure that the Baltimore County Council passes [new immigrant protections in Baltimore County](https://www.thebanner.com/politics-power/local-government/izzy-patoka-baltimore-county-immigrants-ice-QQSHWVZAFVDLZL72BJKSJXY7E4/), including [Bill 97-25](https://countycouncilweb.s3.amazonaws.com/Bills%202025/b09725.pdf), which makes the Office of Immigrant Affairs permanent, and [Bill 98-25, the Trust Act](https://countycouncilweb.s3.amazonaws.com/Bills%202025/b09825.pdf), which specifies that county officials collect immigration data and coordinate with ICE only when required to by law, e.g. when agents have a judicial warrant or are investigating a crime. 

On January 27 at 4 pm, join us in packing the room at the public hearing on the bills and/or especially if you&apos;re an impacted community member or service provider, [sign up on the county council&apos;s website](https://countycouncil.baltimorecountymd.gov
) on the morning of January 27 to provide 3 minutes of public testimony. 

Can&apos;t make it on January 27? You can provide written testimony and/or write to your council member to express support for these important bills. Reach out to us for talking points. 

The vote on the bill is scheduled for February 2.

***Please note: Indivisible Baltimore County will be following the lead of CASA, ACLU, and organizations representing impacted communities***</p>

<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>We were still outraged over the murder of Renee Goode and then we watched the execution of Alex Pretti. WE CANNOT BE SILENT. Our Federal Government is out of control, terrorizing our immigrant neighbors, violating 14th Amendment Due Process, violating 1st Amendment Free Speech; violating 4th Amendment Search and Seizure laws, even violating 2nd Amendent rights. Purposeful torture of those detained with horrendous conditions, no access to family or legal counsel, moving them out of state, and if possible, out of the Country as soon as possible. These are not the only deaths or serIous injuries at the hands of ICE, or while in ICE detention. Many brown and black detainees have been victims. WE MUST STAND FOR ALL OF THEM! Tell Congressman Harris GET ICE OUT OF EVERYWHERE! DEFUND ICE!

In our own State we have an opportunity to refuse to cooperate with ICE by passing a law to ban local law enforcement from working with ICE. Our Sherriff in Harford County works with ICE, and continues to defend them inspite of the recent public murders. Tell Sherriff Gahler GET ICE OUT OF HARFORD COUNTY. GET ICE OUT OF MARYLAND!

<h3>Organizing Volunteers for No Kings 3 and Presentation by the co-Founder of Hagamos Vaca</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Sunday, February 15, 2026 at 7:00 PM UTC - 9:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>James City County Recreation Center<br>5301 Longhill Rd<br>Williamsburg, VA 23188</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Williamsburg JCC Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Please join us on Sunday, February 15th at 2pm at the James City County Recreation Center, located at 5301 Longhill Road, for a meeting concerning upcoming Indivisible actions, including No Kings 3 and a special presentation concerning the non-profit Hagamos Vaca.

We are extremely fortunate to have Jonathan Westmoreland, an ESL and Spanish teacher in a local public school, speak with us about the 501(c)(3) nonprofit he co-founded, Hagamos Vaca, which is rooted in this community. &quot;In Spanish, &quot;hagamos vaca&quot; means &quot;let’s chip in.&quot; It’s what you say when the problem is bigger than one person can fix, but together, we’ve got it covered. That’s exactly what we’re doing—pooling our money, time, and whatever else it takes to make sure immigrant families in New Kent, King William, James City County, Hampton Roads, and other communities have a roof over their heads, food in the fridge, and a community that has their backs.&quot;

We will also be organizing volunteers for No Kings 3 - date still not announced. We had over 6,000 people at our No Kings 2 and expect a much bigger crowd with everything occurring in our Country. Volunteer positions will include marshals, setup, sign-ins, greeters, first aid, bringing supplies, such as coolers with water/ice, etc... Please participate in some way to help facilitate a great event. Thank you!</p>

<h3>ICE Out for Good of Elizabethtown</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Friday, January 16, 2026 at 5:00 AM UTC - 5:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Lancaster Together</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Communities across the country are rising up to say enough is enough after the killing of Renée Nicole Good, an unarmed American mother of three, by an ICE agent. So many other victims have been shot by masked and unaccountable ICE agents. Join Elizabethtown and surrounding municipalities to stand against ICE violence and demand accountability at every level of government.

Our Specific Local Demands

• End Northwest Regional’s cooperation with ICE • Reverse Mount Joy Borough’s vote to cooperate with ICE • Elizabethtown Borough must not consider ICE cooperation • Fulfill all actions required by Elizabethtown Resolution 2020-06 on Racial Justice, Equity, and Action — and release public reports • Repeal Elizabethtown Resolution 2024-09 designating the borough a “Non-Sanctuary City”

Sign our petition to ask our local governments in Elizabethtown and nearby not to collaborate with ICE, to end their existing contracts, and to vow not to enter into new ones.</p>

The whole world is watching Minneapolis and many of us are asking: what do we do if ICE comes to our community? Join us to hear from Matt Johnson about your Constitutional rights during ICE enforcement and how to keep our whole community safe.

Unchecked and unlawful actions by federal DHS employees remind us that citizens need to know their rights in order to speak out with confidence. Attend this training with one of our local experts so you can understand better what you can do, and be in a position to share that information with others. 

Let&apos;s all take care of ourselves and each other!</p>

<h3>Focused Accountability Campaign</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Thursday, February 12, 2026 at 11:30 PM UTC - 1:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Lancaster Together</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Hope in Action Lancaster is focusing on local public officials one by one, holding them accountable for complicity with the Trump regime, or for their passivity in the face of this onslaught.

We intend to start with the Lancaster County Sheriff, who signed a 287g contract with ICE. We are looking to have folks contact the sheriff&apos;s office regularly with questions and offering their opinion in a sustained, coordinated way. We plan to use phone calls, emails, letters, and letters to the editor.

After this campaign we intend to turn our sights on other local elected officials who are culpable in the current trend towards authoritarianism. Join us for our sessions.

This meeting is every 2nd and 4th Thursday evenings of the month. It is a collaboration with Solidarity Lancaster and Indivisible Lancaster Together, but all are welcome.

**All Indivisible events are nonviolent and participants are encouraged to de-escalate any conflicts.**</p>

Our community is coming together to stand for human dignity, family unity, and fair treatment for all people — no matter where they come from.

Recent immigration enforcement actions across the country have left many families living in fear and uncertainty. We believe our neighborhoods should be places of safety, opportunity, and compassion — not intimidation. This peaceful protest is a call for accountability, transparency, and policies that respect basic human rights.

We are gathering to:

Stand in solidarity with immigrant families in our community

Speak out against harmful detention and deportation practices

Demand humane, just, and community-centered immigration policies

Show that our town believes in fairness, dignity, and due process for all

This will be a peaceful, family-friendly event. We encourage signs, stories, and voices that uplift human rights and reflect the values of compassion and justice. Community leaders, advocates, and neighbors will have opportunities to speak.

✊ What to bring: Signs, water, weather-appropriate clothing, and a commitment to peaceful action.
❤️ Who should come: Families, faith groups, workers, students, and anyone who believes our community is strongest when we stand together.

When we show up together, we send a clear message: our neighbors are not disposable, and our community will not be silent.

Together, we choose humanity.</p>

<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>In the year of 2026, we understand that times are getting tougher. Our streets in our country are being militarized by ICE agents, families being ripped apart, while our people are struggling to pay rent. The reality is many of us are struggling to afford groceries, afford adequate child care, struggling to access affordable health care, get our medicine, and live our lives.

While the poor and working class continue to be stepped on, we know its Billionaires and big cooperations who get to fill their pockets, while the rest of us struggle. Through our struggle we must come together and remind ourselves that there are more of us than there are of them, it&apos;s time to fight back.

Join us in our fight to win back Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and our country. It will take all of us, we need each other more than ever.

This will be a hybrid event, so RSVP whether or not you intend to join in person!</p>

<h3>Candlelight Vigil for Alex, Renee, and all the Fallen</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Friday, January 30, 2026 at 10:30 PM UTC - 11:30 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Penn Square<br><br>Lancaster, PA 17602</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Lancaster Together</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Remember Alex Pretti, ICU Nurse

Please join health care works and faith leaders at a candlelight vigil for those killed by ICE, CBP, and other DHS personnel. We&apos;ll be at Penn Square in Downtown Lancaster with the event starting at 5:30pm.

We especially remember Alex Pretti, an ICU nurse with the VA, who was executed while caring for and protecting his community, just as he cared for his patients. 

We remember Renee Good, a mother, wife, and poet, who was simply looking to help her community. 

And we gather to remember all the innocent lives lost to and destroyed by immigration raids and other attacks on our neighbors, especially in the last few weeks in Minneapolis. We remember them as people: as parents, spouses, and children; as caregivers and protectors; as heroes and regular people, just trying to both make it in America, and giving of themselves to make America better. 

These murders at the hands of our government deserve to be called out. Beyond killings, the devastation of current immigration detentions and deportations, which Alex, Renee, and others were resisting, also must be condemned. 

And also, we as a community can come together to share our grief and sadness at the incredible human cost of these senseless raids, done in the name of a misguided policy by dishonest people. We can lament, and we can hug, and we can also gear up for what comes ahead.

For we also must resolve to carry on the work of these fallen in order to wake our country up from its complacency and fight for a better world, a welcoming world, a peaceful world where all can live together in health, harmony, and acceptance. 

**All Indivisible actions are peaceful and non-violent. Please seek to de-escalate any conflicts.**</p>

Indivisible Newark DE joins with communities across the country to voice our grief and outrage at the murder of Alex Pretti, a hero who was executed by masked ICE thugs last week as he came to the aid of a fellow ICE observer in Minneapolis.

Alex is the second person to be killed in less than a month by the occupation forces in the Twin Cities.  In both cases, the Trump regime has responded by blocking investigations, libeling the victims, and claiming it can murder with impunity.  We cannot allow lawless secret police to continue terrorizing Americans.

When banks fund ICE detention, they are not neutral — they are complicit.

        <name>CANCELLED FRIDAY JAN 30 ** ICE OUT** Fetterman Vote NO to Funding ICE</name>
        <description><![CDATA[
<h3>CANCELLED FRIDAY JAN 30 ** ICE OUT** Fetterman Vote NO to Funding ICE</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Friday, January 30, 2026 at 5:00 PM UTC - 6:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>William S. Moorhead Federal Building<br>1000 Liberty Ave<br>Pittsburgh, PA 15222</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Pittsburgh</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>**THE FRIDAY JANARY 30 RALLY AT SENATOR FETTERMAN&apos;S OFFICE IS CANCELLED** 


Why are we cancelling?

1. ON THURSDAY, JANUARY 29, THE SENATE VOTED NO on cloture, meaning NO VOTE to fund ICE and border patrol. Sen. Fetterman voted with EVERY SINGLE Democrat and 8 Republicans to deny Republicans a vote to fund ICE. This is EXACTLY what we wanted to happen but it is a temporary reprieve. Keep an eye out for our next actions.

2. It will be dangerously cold tomorrow and we don&apos;t want you to be out in the streets with us unless we NEED to be there.

Additional background:

On TUESDAY, JANUARY 27th through FRIDAY, JANUARY 30, join Indivisible Pittsburgh and our partners to tell Senator Fetterman to Block Cloture and Say NO to the DHS Funding Bill which funds ICE. 

We will gather at NOON each day in front of Sen. Fetterman&apos;s office at 1000 Liberty Ave. Bring a sign and a letter to the senator if you can. Dress for the weather (it will be COLD). 

Background: Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents are unleashing violence in our communities – pulling refugees from their homes and breaking down doors without warrants. On Saturday January 24th, another person who sought to defend their neighbors was murdered by federal agents. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) press office is essentially a propaganda machine, openly using neo-Nazi rhetoric and justifies murder and falsely tars us as domestic terrorists for daring to seek accountability. The American public is outraged by what they see. Constituents are looking to Congress to rein in DHS—not give the agency more money.

Yet in this historical moment, Democrats and Republican leaders in Congress will vote on a plan to give DHS more money. They have released a proposed bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security for Fiscal Year 2026 that will give ICE an additional $400 million more for detention and $370 million more for enforcement on top of the unprecedented $45 billion ICE got through the 2025 reconciliation bill, paid for by cutting health care and nutrition assistance.

The bill passed the House on Thursday, Jan 22, and now the Senate is scheduled to vote on it Tuesday, Jan 27, in the late afternoon. Due to the outrageous actions and the brave response to the occupation in Minneapolis, Minority Leader Schumer has promised that the Democrats will vote NO in order to strip the DHS funding from the budget and 

Multiple Senators who had planned to vote in favor have stated they will now vote No. Senator Fetterman must also vote NO on Tuesday in order to block cloture on the funding bill and remove the funding for DHS. Congress cannot give DHS more money without meaningful oversight over the agency terrorizing communities.</p>

<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Indivisible Worcester MD is extending our ICE OUT FOR GOOD demonstrations to every Saturday at 2 pm in Ocean Pines. 70 people came out on Jan 11 and 75 attended on Jan 17. We&apos;re on a roll; let&apos;s keep the momentum going!

This will be announced with other Indivisible events on mobilize.us, via email to the Indivisible Worcester mailing list (if you are not receiving email notices from us, go to http://tinyurl.com/indivisibleworcestermd to sign

Parking--There is a small lot near the Veterans Memorial  that you can reach through the back of the Sports Core Pool lot.  You can also park at the public library across Cathell Rd.

<h3>Abolish ICE</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, January 31, 2026 at 3:00 PM UTC - 5:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Pottstown Plaza<br>799 N State St<br>Pottstown, PA 19464</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Protests continue to grow across the U.S. as citizens stand up against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) due to concerns over harsh enforcement tactics, family separations, detention conditions, and recent high-profile incidents, like the fatal shooting of Renee Good. This is leading to demands for agency reform or abolition, focusing on human rights, humane treatment, and a more compassionate immigration approach. 

We will continue to protest mass raids, deportations, and conditions in detention centers, advocating for immigrant rights and challenging federal policies, especially those under the Trump administration. 

Key Reasons To Protest:

Police Brutality &amp; Shootings: Recent events have sparked widespread outrage. We are demanding accountability.

Family Separations: The Trump administration&apos;s &quot;zero tolerance&quot; policy led to mass family separations, galvanizing the &quot;Abolish ICE&quot; movement. We are demanding an end to these practices.

Detention Conditions: Poor medical care, inadequate conditions, and deaths in ICE detention facilities. We are calling for better treatment and closure of these centers.

Mass Raids &amp; Deportations: Increased ICE enforcement, including workplace raids and operations in sensitive areas like schools. This fuels our protests against perceived overreach and community disruption.

Human Rights Concerns: ICE&apos;s actions are inhumane, violating human rights and tearing apart communities. We are fighting for a more just immigration system.

Systemic Issues:  ICE enforcement has lead to broader issues like mass criminalization, linking immigration enforcement to environmental justice, Indigenous rights, and LGBTQ+ rights. 

What We Stand For:

~Abolition or significant reform of ICE.

~An end to family detention and separation.

~Better conditions and care in detention centers.

~More humane approaches to immigration enforcement.

*A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*</p>

<h3>Citizens Bank: Stop Funding Cruelty Limerick</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 7, 2026 at 4:00 PM UTC - 5:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Citizens Bank<br>429 W Ridge Pike<br>Limerick, PA 19468</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Montgomery County PA &amp; Friends</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>📅 Join us Saturday, February 7th, at 11 AM as we come together across Pennsylvania to send a message to Citizens Bank and raise awareness in our communities about Citizen’s role in supporting for-profit detention operators.

Citizens Financial Group, through subsidiaries like Citizens Bank, has long financed private prison and detention operators despite decades of allegations of abuse, neglect, forced labor, and fraud. Companies like CoreCivic and GEO Group have caused widespread harm — including wrongful deaths, medical neglect, and exploitation.

Right here in Pennsylvania, GEO operates the Moshannon Valley Processing Center, the largest ICE detention facility in the Northeast, just three hours from Montgomery County. Join us-- and others statewide-- to tell Citizens Bank that we want them to stop supporting cruelty.

We would like to hold actions at more branch locations based on interest.</p>

<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Citizens Bank is a major lender to Geo Group and Core Civic, both of whom run private prisons and detention facilities like Delany Hall in Newark, Elizabeth Detention in Elizabeth NJ, and Moshannon in Pennsylvania.  

After ICE abducts our friends and neighbors, Delaney Hall, Elizabeth Detention Center and Moshannon are where most of them are taken.

<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Workers, customers, and communities deserve safety, dignity, and transparency everywhere in America. When corporations enable attacks on our civil rights instead of supporting the people in their community, we need to let them know that we demand better from them in a peaceful way.

Let&apos;s use our BUYING POWER to send a message to Target to Stand Up to ICE in MN and across the U.S. We ask them to enact and enforce business policies that protect against unlawful search &amp; seizure and unlawful detainment according to 4th Amendment rights held by both citizens &amp; businesses. 

Our PEACEFUL PRESENCE &amp; VISIBILITY draws attention of the management of corporations and of our fellow community members! Similar actions were taken with ice scrapers last month in LA.

<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>📅 Join us Saturday, February 7th, at 11 AM as we come together across Pennsylvania to send a message to Citizens Bank and raise awareness in our communities about Citizen’s role in supporting for-profit detention operators.

Citizens Financial Group, through subsidiaries like Citizens Bank, has long financed private prison and detention operators despite decades of allegations of abuse, neglect, forced labor, and fraud. Companies like CoreCivic and GEO Group have caused widespread harm — including wrongful deaths, medical neglect, and exploitation.

Right here in Pennsylvania, GEO operates the Moshannon Valley Processing Center, the largest ICE detention facility in the Northeast, just three hours from Montgomery County. Join us-- and others statewide-- to tell Citizens Bank that we want them to stop supporting cruelty.

We would like to hold actions at more branch locations based on interest.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
<h3>February SURJ members General Meeting in the Eno River Area!</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Sunday, February 8, 2026 at 6:00 PM UTC - 8:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Durham Central Park Co-Housing<br>130 Hunt St<br>Durham, NC 27701</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Showing Up for Racial Justice</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>The right has revved up their attacks on our communities and neighbors, and now is the time fight back. 

We&apos;ll be continuing our work of **Block &amp; Build**: defending our communities from harm while building the power we need to win long-term change. We do this by focusing on two concrete areas: Strengthening and participating in [**Siembra’s organizing**](https://www.siembranc.org/) to resist government overreach and ICE raids while also moving people to action in [**SURJ’s national campaigns**](https://surj.org/current-campaigns/)



✨ **SAVE THE DATE** ✨
**Sunday, Feb 8th
1:00–2:30pm** (+ social time afterwards!)
Location will be downtown Durham. Make sure to **RSVP** so we can confirm the location with you!

**Who SHOULD attend**
Are you interested in building deeper, long-term relationships with other white people who want to fight for racial and economic justice by building power together in our community?

You don’t need prior training, organizing experience, or deep familiarity with the work. This meeting is for people who are ready to move toward action and shared responsibility—not just learning about the work. If that sounds like you, we’d love to have you.

*Introduction to SURJ: Showing Up for Racial Justice (SURJ) is a national organization that organizes white people to fight for racial and economic justice. For too long, the Right has used racism to divide us and protect the wealth and power of billionaires. Locally, we are SURJ volunteers in the Eno river area who work to turn concern into action by bringing people together to resist harm in our communities and build the skills, commitments, and collective power needed for lasting change.*</p>

<h3>Stand with Minnesota: ICE Out! Durham, Shut it Down!</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Friday, January 30, 2026 at 6:00 PM UTC - 8:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>211 W Parrish St<br>Durham, NC 27701</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Engaged Defenders for Democracy</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Many organizations have come together as a coalition as we stand together in unity with Minneapolis. Durham is awesome. These organizations are working together:

PSL
ED4D
Amazon CAUSE
Southern Workers Assembly
Pal Youth
50501NC
Sunrise Duke
Durham Youth Activist

As we all know, in Minneapolis on Saturday, Border Patrol agents shot and killed Alex Pretti execution style as Alex was attempting to help a woman who had been pepper-sprayed. They shot Alex after multiple officers held him down. This is the second brutal murder at the hands of ICE in Minneapolis this month. Earlier this month, they also killed Keith Porter Jr. and Renee Good. All were US Citizens. 

ICE also has killed: Heber Sanchaz Domínguez, Victor Manuel Diaz, Parady La, Luis Gustavo Nunez Caceres, Geraldo Lunas Campos, and Francisco Gaspar-Andres just since January 1, 2026.

ICE needs to be held accountable. And we need them out of our cities!

ICE cannot continue killing people. They must stop! We the People Have Power! 

Students groups will be walking out on Friday as part of the General Strike. They are partnering with unions and many organizations including the Party for Socialism and Liberation and Engaged Defenders for Democracy on Friday January 30th at noon. All will come together as part of a General Strike in Durham. We will gather in DT Durham at 1pm for a rally at The Bull. We are not ok with this, and we need to let people know.

We will meet at CCB Plaza or &quot;The Bull&quot; 211 W. Parrish Street.

Come with signs saying, &quot;Abolish ICE&quot; and &quot;ICE out of our cities.&quot;

Let&apos;s do this folks!! I won&apos;t be at the whole rally but will come when I can.

Warmly,

Kathryn</p>

<h3>ABOLISH ICE</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Thursday, February 5, 2026 at 12:30 PM UTC - 3:30 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>4601 Capital Blvd<br>Raleigh, NC 27604</p>

<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>**Every Thursday from 7:30 - 10:30AM**, please join the Woke County Resistance (WCR), Fayetteville Resistance Coalition (FRC), and your fellow North Carolinians to send a clear message:

▶️ **ICE and CBP have endangered our communities and taken lives.** Our neighbors fear for their livelihoods and their lives, and our communities are less safe. We won&apos;t stand for it.

▶️ **ICE has been escalating its cruel deployments into our communities.** This recent killing is not an isolated incident, but the devastating and predictable result of ICE’s lawless operations and President Trump&apos;s abuse of power.

▶️ **We demand accountability for the killing and an end to ICE and CBP raids.** We will not sit by while violence goes unanswered and our communities are terrorized.

_We will meet ICE’s violence with steadfast nonviolence and lawful protest._</p>

<h3>ONE PEOPLE&apos;s No Kings 3 United Pushback</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, March 28, 2026 at 4:00 PM UTC - 6:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Summit Square Shopping Ctr<br>1717 Langhorne Newtown Rd<br>Langhorne, PA 19047</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> ONE PEOPLE</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Last year, in thousands of towns and cities across the country, millions poured into the streets for the largest single-day protest in US history. 

On March 28 we&apos;ll take to the streets again, ready to bring millions of new allies along with us to declare, in one voice: NO thugs terrorizing our neighborhoods. NO troop deployments in our streets. NO imperial wars of conquest. NO KINGS.

Trump clearly wishes to rule like a king. But -- as every community targeted by ICE and CBP has shown -- we the people refuse to cower in the face of his cruelty. This country doesn&apos;t bow down to tyrants. We sure as hell won&apos;t bow down to the kinds of wretched ghouls who kidnap children, teargas schools, and murder our neighbors then slander them as domestic terrorists.

This regime’s ongoing brutality and authoritarianism have only convinced more Americans, including many who’ve never attended a protest in their lives, to join their neighbors in the streets. Now we&apos;ve got to keep that momentum growing, with the same creativity and dogged determination.

Everything we&apos;ve done so far is the stuff of history. And together, we&apos;ll write the history of how, for the second time in 250 years, we the people defied, and overcame, a tyrant.

Once again ONE PEOPLE will do our part to fight against an Autocratic President and to Safeguard Our Democracy!</p>

<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>St. Bartholomew Lutheran Church<br>1746 S Clinton Ave<br>Trenton, NJ 08610</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Happy New Year, Indivisibles!!! 
We started out 2026 with a sudden and fierce frost! But, we’re getting warmer! The Immigrant Trust Act is on Gov. Murphy’s desk as I write this! It isn’t perfect, but all the parts did pass!!  Our Pop-Up rally, ICE Out for Good was a success and with about 24 hrs to plan, 300 people came out to show their fabulous signs and resounding support for our community. 

At this meeting, we will re-group, discuss immediate and longer term plans. No Kings 3 will be in March (date: tbd).  Bring your ideas, bring your energy! 

We have been successful at coordinating with sister Indivisible groups, 50501, ICE Out of Princeton, Resistencia, St. Bart’s food ministries, etc.! We are stronger and more organized than ever! 

On the table for discussion: ICE prevention and response, elections, rallies and peaceful actions, and any ideas that you bring!

Look forward to seeing you there! 

This a local Indivisible event!

*A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*</p>

<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>251 N Main St<br>Winston-Salem, NC 27101</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Camel City United Indivisible North Carolina</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>This is a county-wide show of force on the last day of early voting.
We vote — then we gather in the streets to be seen, counted, and heard.

We’re calling hundreds of people, neighborhood by neighborhood —
from apartment communities to cul-de-sacs, churches to block groups —
to stand together and fill the space.

Our message is clear:
No fascism.
No ICE.
Yes to people power.

This isn’t one group organizing for the community.
This is the community organizing itself — and bringing its people.

Numbers matter.
Visibility matters.
Consistency matters.

Show up strong.
Stand shoulder-to-shoulder.
Make the statement.

Vote by 3.
Rage at 4.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
<h3>ICE Out of Everywhere: Olean</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, January 31, 2026 at 4:00 PM UTC - 5:30 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Lincoln Park<br>100 E State St<br>Olean, NY 14760</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Voices of the People Movement</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Join us! ✊
ICE Out of Everywhere
Sat January 31st
11a-12:30p
Lincoln Park - Olean, NY

Voices of the People Movement and CALC (Cattaraugus-Allegany Liberation Collective) are mobilizing for the “ICE Out Everywhere” national day of action on Saturday, where communities in all 50 states will come together to protest and to demand the blocking of DHS funding until ICE and CBP are permanently removed from our streets, the abolition of ICE and dismantling of DHS, and justice for the murders of 38 detainees, as well as Keith Porter, Renee Nicole Good and Alex Pretti.

The execution of Alex Pretti is part of a brutal pattern of ICE entering American communities, terrorizing its citizens, and abducting and killing innocent civilians. Alex Pretti&apos;s execution was not the first tragic incident to occur since ICE paramilitary forces invaded Minnesota. There have been countless abuses against civilians, families have been ripped apart, children have been used as bait and abducted, and ICE has murdered multiple civilians while on patrol or while holding civilians in ICE facilities. The onus is on the US, the people, to stop this campaign of terror. This is a direct attack on our communities AND our democracy. The Trump administration is trying to strike fear and docility in the hearts of our community members: we will not comply. 



** It is going to be very cold Saturday. Please  do not feel obligated to stay the whole time. We recommend wearing lots of layers and maybe bringing a warm beverage. **


As always, a core principle behind our events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek a Marshal during the event to help de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values and to act lawfully at these events. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events.</p>

<h3>ICE Out Amazon</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, January 31, 2026 at 6:00 PM UTC - 7:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Whole Foods Market<br>113 US-9<br>Manalapan Township, NJ 07726</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Next Shore Neighbors</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>ICE Out Amazon, NOW!

It&apos;s time to tell Amazon to stop cooperating with ICE! 

As ICE and DHS have expanded their campaign of terror, Amazon has knowingly provided the technology to fuel their mass surveillance and deportation efforts. 

While our neighbors are being terrorized, families are torn apart, and innocent people are murdered in the street, Amazon continues to profit off of ICE brutality. 

It&apos;s time to say ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. Boycott Amazon and its subsidiaries (including Whole Foods). Let&apos;s send a message that we will NOT support corporations that cooperate with ICE. 

Bring your signs and be ready to make some noise! 

**Please stay on the sidewalk and do not engage with counter-protesters. We are committed to peaceful, nonviolent action.</p>

<h3>Roxbury, NJ Says No to ICE Detention</h3>

<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Roxbury Township Town Hall<br>1715 US-46<br>Roxbury Township, NJ 07852</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Bogota Community Defense</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Join a community call to action to stop an ICE detention facility from being built in Roxbury, NJ. Show up to the city council meeting to make it clear that all of New Jersey opposes the so called &quot;Amazon warehouse for humans&quot;, and that Roxbury rejects having the detention in their backyard.

Attendees will have the option to use a three-minute public comment slot to speak directly to the council, or you can simply stand with neighbors to demonstrate unified opposition to this project. Your presence matters and visible turnout influences decisions. If you&apos;re planning to speak, please be respectful but assertive. Don&apos;t insult, don&apos;t let the rage out all the way, but let them see that it makes you angry, let them see how this is making you feel. Show them that this is wrong. Together, we are united!</p>

<h3>ICE OUT OF EVERYWHERE - Elmira Protest</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, January 31, 2026 at 4:00 PM UTC - 6:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>317 E Church St<br>Elmira, NY 14901</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>The people of the Twin Cities have shown the way for the whole country – to stop ICE’s reign of terror, we need to SHUT IT DOWN. On Friday, January 30, join a nationwide day of no school, no work and no shopping. 

The entire country is shocked and outraged at the brutal killings of Alex Pretti, Renee Good, Silverio Villegas González, and Keith Porter Jr. by federal agents. While Trump and other right wing politicians are slandering them as “terrorists”, the video evidence makes it clear beyond all doubt: they were gunned down in broad daylight simply for exercising their First Amendment right to protest mass deportation. Every day, ICE, Border Patrol and other enforcers of Trump’s racist agenda are going into our communities to kidnap our neighbors and sow fear. It is time for us to all stand up together in a nationwide shutdown and say enough is enough!

(50501 Twin Tiers is hosting this event, a partner of Indivisible).

*A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*</p>

<h3>Malliotakis Mondays | Bay Ridge</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Monday, February 2, 2026 at 9:45 PM UTC - 10:45 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Rep. Malliotakis&apos; Brooklyn District Office<br>7716 3rd Ave.<br>Brooklyn, NY 11209</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Brooklyn</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>**Join Us for a Vigil for Minnesota &amp; Accountability**

Rep. Nicole Malliotakis recently published an op-ed proudly celebrating the “One Big Beautiful Bill” she passed—taking away people&apos;s healthcare and food assistance, while massively expanding funding for ICE to levels far surpassing agencies that pursue terrorists, drug traffickers, and violent criminals.

That funding is now powering lawless, militarized federal forces operating with impunity—killing, injuring, and drawing guns against peaceful, law-abiding people in our streets, most recently VA nurse Alex Pretti.

We will gather in a vigil to honor the brave, peaceful civic resistance of people in Minnesota and across the country, and to demand Rep. Malliotakis choose a side: the people or ICE and the architects of a violent and dehumanizing agenda of ethnic cleansing.

<h3>Weekly Vigil for Democracy at the Brooklyn Metropolitan Detention Center</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, February 3, 2026 at 11:00 PM UTC - 12:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>116 29th St<br>Brooklyn, NY 11232</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Brooklyn</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Join us in standing up for our neighbors, held at the notorious prison in our own back yard. For years, the Metropolitan Detention Center has had a reputation for inhumane conditions: rancid food, lack of heating in winter and oppressive heat in summer. In 2020, an inmate named Jamel Floyd was killed by corrections officers by excessive use of force. Now, ICE is using the Metropolitan Detention Center to house our immigrant neighbors -- mothers, fathers, sons and daughters -- who have been taken from their homes, schools, and workplaces and held in detention.

Our fellow organizers at Good Shepherd Lutheran Church in Bay Ridge are holding for a weekly vigil outside the MDC to call for the release of ICE detainees, and to stand against the inhumane treatment of our neighbors. Supporters are invited to bring signs, to sing or play music, and to solemnly bear witness in solidarity. Together we will build and strengthen the vital community connections.

* We gather first at the corner of 3rd Avenue and 29th Street.</p>

Join volunteers with Target Majority NYC to talk to business owners and managers and teach them the crucial Know Your Rights info they need to better protect their employees in the event of an ICE Raid. You&apos;ll help them put up signs to declare their solidarity, and to create as much protection as possible within their place of work.

We will provide training on the spot, but you can also start prepping now by visiting https://tinyurl.com/startSOS

<h3>Stronger Than Fear: Eat, Shop, and Show Up for Palisades Park</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, January 31, 2026 at 5:00 PM UTC - 7:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Broad Ave<br>Palisades Park, NJ 07650</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> AAPI New Jersey</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Join AAPI NJ on Saturday, 1/31 from 12-2pm to eat, shop, and support immigrant-owned small businesses impacted by recent ICE activity in Palisades Park. 

This past week, we have heard from many community members in the area who are feeling isolated and fearful after recent ICE raids. Broad Avenue, usually a center of daily life, has been quiet--creating hardship for its small businesses.

In response, we invite Asian Americans and allies who feel safe enough to do so to come out with us to eat and shop together along Broad Avenue, led by community members who are excited to share their favorite bakeries, local snacks, and places to shop! We will also share information in Korean and English on how to stay safe during immigration enforcement encounters with those who wish to receive it. Please join us in Palisades Park and help show that community is stronger than fear.

No cost to attend, but please bring funds to cover your purchases and RSVP for the meeting point. See you there!

두려움을 넘어 강하게: 팰리세이즈 파크를 위해 함께 먹고, 쇼핑하고, 뜻을 함께 합시다!



행사 안내
AAPI NJ와 함께 1월 31일(토) 낮 12시부터 오후 2시까지 팰리세이즈 파크에서 모여, 최근 이민단속국(ICE) 활동으로 피해를 입은 우리 이민자 소상공인들을 응원하며 함께 식사하고 쇼핑하면서 돕는 시간을 가집니다.
지난주, 최근 ICE 단속 이후 불안감과 소외감을 느끼고 있다는 지역 주민들의 목소리를 많이 전해 들었습니다. 이번 사태로 인해 평소 우리 지역 일상의 중심이었던 브로드 애비뉴(Broad Avenue)는 한산해졌고, 이 지역 소상공인들이 큰 어려움을 겪고 있습니다.
이에 따라, 아시아계 미국인과 뜻을 함께하는분들을 이번 이벤트에 초대합니다. 지역 주민들의 안내로 함께 브로드 애비뉴를 걸으며, 좋아하는 베이커리, 로컬 음식, 쇼핑 장소를 소개받고 함께 그 곳을 이용할 예정입니다. 또한 원하시는 분들께는 이민 단속 상황에서 안전을 지키는 방법에 대한 정보 자료를 한국어와 영어로 제공할 예정입니다.
팰리세이즈 파크에서 함께해 주시고, 우리가 함께하는 공동체는 두려움을 이겨낸다는 메시지를 전달합시다.
참가비는 없지만, 개인이 구매를 하거나 음식을 먹을 경우, 내는 비용을 준비해 주세요. 참여 하시는 분은  RSVP 해주시면, 모이는 장소를 알려 드리겠습니다. 그날 뵙겠습니다!</p>

<h3>National Day of Lobbying: Impeach, Convict, and Remove - Hickory, NC</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, February 17, 2026 at 8:00 PM UTC - 9:30 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Pat Harrigan&apos;s office on campus of App State Hickory<br>800 17th St NW suite g467<br>Hickory, NC 28601</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> 50501Missouri</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>In the first week of 2026, the administration engaged in three flagrant abuses of power: (1) an unconstitutional military strike in Venezuela, (2) the extrajudicial murder of Renee Nicole Good by a member of the ICE paramilitary force for exercising her first amendment rights, and (3) the continued obstruction of justice for victims of Jeffrey Epstein’s child sex trafficking ring. 

Impeachment is not optional. It is the remedy mandated by the Constitution.

FLARE USA, Citizens&apos; Impeachment, and 50501 Movement are proud to announce the next National Day of Action: in-district lobbying on February 17, 2026 for the impeachment, conviction, and removal of President Trump. Representatives will be in their districts; catch them at home and demand they use their power to remove this unconstitutional regime!

Grassroots pro-democracy organizations (e.g., local chapters of Indivisible, Hands Off, 50501), progressive primary candidates, and other concerned citizens will join together in leading constituents into the local/in-district offices of all 435 US House Representatives to demand impeachment. 

All participants are committed to lawful, non-violent action and no civil disobedience. 

Further training materials to follow soon.</p>

<h3>Stop the Cruelty, Columbus</h3>

<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>395 E Broad St<br>Columbus, OH 43215</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Central Ohio</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>This protest is at 395 E. Broad St, across the street from the intersection of Cleveland and Broad. There is parking in the area.  

Please note that this is not an ICE facility; it&apos;s an immigration and customs office.  We protest there to take advantage of rush hour traffic and do so after the office is closed so that we won&apos;t frighten people away from their appointments.

We provide the signs, which have red lettering on a white background and say, “Stop the Cruelty.” We all use the same sign to maximize visual impact. We are a silent protest, although we do talk among ourselves. We have a policy of not hassling ICE officers who wander by. Anger and resentment are Donald Trump&apos;s tools, they&apos;re not ours. Everyone is welcome!</p>

<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>All over the country, **ICE agents are targeting immigrants in and around Home Depot**, attacking and terrorizing workers, customers, and surrounding communities. The raids are terrifying, chaotic, and sometimes deadly.

These **atrocities are happening on Home Depot’s watch, on its properties, with its silence**. The Home Depot company has not resisted or condemned these raids.

**Join us in a buy-in action** that has been successfully implemented across the country! In groups, we will line up to make the same small purchase (89 cent putty knives as long as they last) several times. We will then line up again to return our purchases. We will hand out a list of alternative hardware stores to the customers whose shopping is disrupted, along with information about Home Depot’s complicity.

Bring $3 in cash so that the purchases and returns take more time.

<h3>Pack Public Comment 2/5</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Thursday, February 5, 2026 at 10:30 PM UTC - 11:30 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>255 Main St 3rd floor<br>Goshen, NY 10924</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Orange County Democratic Committee</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Pack Public Comment is back, but now, thanks to our Democratic legislative majority, your impact will be amplified more than ever. The Democratic Caucus is taking on tough issues, and as one of their first acts they moved half of the regular meetings of the County Legislature to the evening. This marks the first time in 60 years where it&apos;s becoming truly accessible for our working class neighbors to make their voices heard. 

At the February 5th meeting, two key issues sponsored by Democratic Legislators will be voted on. Our margins are close, and it&apos;s crucial we make our voices heard to generate bipartisan support for what matters: 

- A resolution to OPPOSE the construction of new ICE facilities in Orange County, like the detention facility being proposed in Chester. 

- The creation of a new task force on public transportation, with the goal of making these services more accessible county-wide. 

Please use this link to RSVP, whether you intend to speak or just attend in solidarity. We will share more information on the agenda items and meeting logistics with everyone who signs up. If you plan to speak you must sign up for public comment, or have someone sign you up, by 6:00PM. 

Public comment on agenda items is at the beginning of the meeting. We encourage you to share your personal experiences and reasons why these initiatives impact you and your community.</p>

<h3>ICE Out For Good Freeport, NY</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, January 31, 2026 at 2:00 PM UTC - 6:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>123 S Main St<br>Freeport, NY 11520</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Wednesday, January 7th, an American citizen was killed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Minneapolis, Minnesota. This killing is part of a broader pattern of unchecked violence, impunity, and abuse carried out by federal immigration enforcement agencies against members of our communities. 

A broad coalition of groups across the country is calling for a coordinated Ice Out For Good Weekend of Action on Saturday, January 10th and Sunday, January 11th to demand accountability, honor the life lost, and make visible the human cost of ICE’s actions. 

A core principle behind all ICE Out For Good events is a commitment to nonviolent action and no civil disobedience. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values, and to act lawfully at these events. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events. All events should be held in public spaces or on public property.

Indivisible is managing data and communications with participants. By registering, you agree to receive info from Indivisible about the event, receive communications via e-mail or SMS message from Indivisible, and receive any other updates and opportunities to take action or support ICE OUT FOR GOOD partner organizations. You also agree to have any data entered in this registration collected by Indivisible.

<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Wednesday, January 7th, an American citizen was killed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Minneapolis, Minnesota. This killing is part of a broader and controversial pattern of unchecked violence, impunity, and abuse carried out by federal immigration enforcement agencies against members of our communities. 

A broad coalition of groups across the country is calling for a coordinated Ice Out  until they are no longer invading our communities.
On this President’s Day we will be a holding a Candlelight Vigil to remember all the people that have lost their lives to ICE. We have a President who is accountable to the citizens he serves . He is NOT A KING. We are not his subjects and he can not use ICE to control  us !

We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values, and to act lawfully at these events. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events. All events should be held in public spaces or on public property.

<h3>NO! WAR! PROTEST by SANDUSKY INDIVISIBLE</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 7, 2026 at 6:00 PM UTC - 9:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Sandusky Mall<br>4314 Milan Rd<br>Sandusky, OH 44870</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Trump is waging war and committing murder to enrich his billionaire backers. We are fighting to stop him. Stand with us and take action this weekend to demand an end to the occupation of Venezuela and our cities.
We stand united demanding an end to the Venezuelan occupation and the removal of reckless untrained ICE agents from our communities. 

Together we will force the administration to end the occupation of Venezuela and our cities and spread the word to our neighbors that we deserve better.

Every dollar spent in wars overseas or at home is a dollar we paid for with our taxes - a dollar that could and should go to helping our communities thrive. We can have good jobs, better schools, access to healthcare and get our basic needs met. But not while our government works for billionaires and not for us.

Join us, stand strong and speak up.

Please note: A core principle behind all our events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events
This a local Sandusky Indivisible event!

<h3>Bethel Defends Democracy: The Shots Heard &apos;Round the World</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, January 31, 2026 at 4:00 PM UTC - 5:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Shakedown Street Eats<br>227 Greenwood Ave<br>Bethel, CT 06801</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Please join us for our 48th consecutive community rally to Defend Democracy in beautiful downtown Bethel. While our overall theme is Defending Democracy, each week we pick a specific focus. On Saturday, January 31st, 11am - noon, our focus will be:

The Shots Heard ‘Round the World

We’re not cold, we’re not afraid. Minnesota taught us to be brave!

“Today we remember that freedom is not free. We have to work at it, nurture it, protect it, and even sacrifice for it. May we never forget and always remember our brothers and sisters who have served so that we may enjoy the gift of freedom.”
         (Alex Pretti a little over a year ago at the deathbed of Terrance Lee Randolph, a veteran Pretti had cared for at the VA hospital in Minneapolis.)

Alex’s murder is a brutal reminder of what’s at stake in this moment. This was not an isolated killing or an accident. When public institutions are weaponized, working people and communities pay the price.

“We all know the poem,” Blue Missouri executive director Jess Piper wrote, “and there is no shade of white that will save you from this murderous regime.”

In the opening weeks of 2026, the MAGA regime made one thing clear. They have abandoned any pretense of governing as usual. They are escalating violence and lawlessness through ICE abductions and killings, international aggression, and open defiance of Congress, including the refusal to release the Epstein files.

History shows that sustained, nonviolent action is what effectively meets this moment.
Appeasement signals weakness and encourages authoritarian escalation. We must stick together at all costs no matter how hard that is at times.

Our movement must evolve to meet this moment. 2026 will not get easier. We have to get stronger together and use our collective power. The people behind all these atrocities must be removed from power.

Building power together requires the work of deep organizing.  We will talk about some ingredients from previous movements to reverse back-sliding democracies which gave the movement a higher probability of success.

Time is of the essence.  Historian, 
Heather Cox Richardson has said we&apos;ll know by May if we are living under a dictatorship.

I believe that we will win!


Guest speaker, Jon Phillips, will speak about  &quot;Why I show up.” He is a father and Bethel resident who regularly attends the Bethel rallies. He believes in creating a world he is proud to leave to his children, and in standing up for his neighbors and community.

To help in MN, some suggested groups to donate to are:
Stand with Minnesota: a resource hub connecting you with mutual aid funds, legal support, food assistance, rent help, and volunteer opportunities https://www.standwithminnesota.com/

MPLS Mutual Aid LinkTree: Central hub for Minneapolis-based mutual aid efforts, like food distribution, support groups, and local collaboration links 
            https://linktr.ee/mplsmutualaid

MN NOICE: Statewide directory of organizations that support immigrants and refugees
https://mnnoice.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email

Immigrant Law Center of Minnesota
            https://www.ilcm.org/
   
Community Aid Network (CANMN), which organizes weekly free food distributions across the Twin Cities and supports volunteer participation
            https://www.canmn.org/

“Save-the Date”: Feb 28th will be our 52nd rally, our 1 Year Anniversary.  But Newtown’s Rock This Democracy has also planned to celebrate their 1 year on that date.  What are the odds?  Therefore, right now we are considering March 14th for a social gathering immediately after the Bethel rally for our 1 year celebration.  More details to come. 

The rally is non-partisan. What this means is that like-minded people from diverse backgrounds are participating and are vital to our rallies. Defending Democracy crosses party lines: we have registered Republicans, Unaffiliated, Democrats, and non-voters, all coming together to fight for the rights of “We the People” to determine the type of society we want to live in.

Never miss information about upcoming rallies by registering for our rally newsletter, bit.ly/BethelRalliesNewsletter (case sensitive).  You can also provide feedback on what you&apos;d like to see at future rallies.  

Questions and feedback are also always welcome anytime at:
BethelDefendsDemocracyRallies@gmail.com.

Visit BethelRallies.org to find videos and pictures from our past rallies.

Note: Rally is rain, snow or shine.  Please bring your own lawn or camping chair.

Approximate Rally Schedule:
11:00 - 11:15  Sign holding at curb 
(you are welcome to come earlier to get extra sign holding time)
11:15 - 11:35  Program
11:35 - Noon  March with chant leader
      Noon        Disperse

***Newer Food Pantry list ***
We collect for Bethel’s food pantry each week. All non-perishable items are greatly appreciated, but the food pantry especially needs: canned and dried fruit, baking soda, baking powder, flour, Taco kits and seasoning, laundry detergent (small containers) and toilet paper.  The pantry also requests clean empty egg cartons (any style).

We have tried to arrange the rallies so there is a little something for everyone: chanting, marching, themes with speakers, live music, fun trinkets, sign making. We appreciate every one of you that attends. Together we can voice our frustrations, build community, and also hopefully learn a little something from experts or your fellow neighbors&apos; experience.

We appreciate your understanding and cooperation. ❤️

Please park at one of the four public parking lots.  We ask that you leave the limited street parking spots open so they are available for patrons of downtown businesses - but definitely enjoy our beautiful town’s restaurants and shops after the rally!

Bring your voice, your spirit, and your friends. Let’s make change visible.

💥 Because the fight for democracy continues through all seasons.

Thank you 😊

<h3>ICE Out! Honor Nurse Alex Pretti. Protect Our Civil Rights.</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Friday, January 30, 2026 at 9:00 PM UTC - 11:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Novant Hospital<br>2131 S 17th St<br>Wilmington, NC 28401</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Join us on Friday, January 30th from 4:00 PM - 6:00 PM to protest the ongoing brutality of federal immigration agents and honor the lives of those victimized by ICE and CBP. We encourage you to bring signs that memorialize victims, shame ICE, and support immigrants in the Cape Fear region.

The main staging area of the protest will be on 17th St. at Novant Hospital, in solidarity with the National Nurses Union&apos;s week of action after the murder of Minneapolis nurse Alex Pretti. 

There will be an optional march from the hospital to the local Customs and Border Protection office at 721 Medical Center Dr. The route is approximately one mile. (Please Note: The marching route is not fully accessible for those using mobility aids.) 

Those arriving to the protest after 5:00 PM are welcome to join the group at the hospital or go directly to the CBP office.

Peace Monitors, street medics, and legal observers will be in attendance.

If mobility is a concern, or you don’t have time to park and join us, you can still contribute in a BIG way from your vehicle! As we’ve learned from past events, the honking horns and cheers from passing vehicles are a major boost to our energy, and the noise draws more attention to the protest. Some people fully dedicate themselves to this important role, making signs or chalking their cars. They drive in loops around the action, honking, cheering, and playing music. The interaction of the pickets and cars is really fun for all!

Co-sponsored by Brunswick Indivisible, ILM Action Network, ILM Democratic Socialists of America, Immigrant Allies Forum, Indivisible Actions SENC, Indivisible Wilmington, the lowercase leaders, Make NC Work, National Black Leadership Caucus, NC AFL-CIO, SE North Carolina Women Forward, Siembra NC, and Women Organizing for Wilmington.

We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values, and to act lawfully at these events. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events. All events should be held in public spaces or on public property.

Tea was once dumped in protest, now we dump ice!

Today, a President who behaves like a king occupies the White House. He has sent ICE to harass our cities, to murder and kidnap our friends, families, and neighbors. Let us rise once more to take down tyranny!

When: Sun, Feb. 8th  at 2 PM Where: Mt Sinai Fishing Pier at Cedar Beach

NO engagement with hecklers, bystanders, agitators, negative people in cars etc. You must always de-escalate, leave space between you and/or walk away. We cannot get baited into responding violently. NO matter the provocation!

<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>3 Main St<br>Newtown, CT 06470</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Newtown Action Alliance</p>

Please join Newtown Action Alliance and Rock This Democracy on Saturday, January 31st, at 11:00AM to Rally and March to Melt Ice!

From the Old Police Station at 3 Main Street, we will march to the Flagpole at the center of our community.

At 11:00AM, we will gather for 30 minutes of speakers and music at the Old Police Station, then march to the flagpole to drive home our message: The violence being created by ICE must be de-escalated. Across the political spectrum our country agrees: what&apos;s been happening is alien to the ideals we cherish as American patriots.

Please RSVP to let us know you will be joining us and please share this invite with your like-minded friends, family, and neighbors.</p>

<h3>Pop up demonstration for the protection of OUR Constitution</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, January 31, 2026 at 4:00 PM UTC - 5:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Assemble on public sidewalks at intersection of<br>Bridge Street &amp; Erie Boulevard East<br>De Witt, NY 13214</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Onondaga County</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>To protectors of the US Constitution,

Mark Twain wrote, “Patriotism is supporting your country all of the time and your government when it deserves it”. We currently have a government regime led by a cruel, corrupt, lawless pathological liar supported by a group of authoritarian gaslighting sycophants. This regime does not deserve our support. It deserves our resistance!

The Framers of the U.S. Constitution created the Bill of Rights and placed Freedom of Assembly, Speech, and Petition of government grievances in the First Amendment in order for action to be taken in times like these.

EVERY SINGLE DAY this regime is violating our Constitution. This regime is invading sovereign countries. Masked lawless federal “agents” are kidnapping our neighbors and now killing citizens in our neighborhoods.

To be clear, we respect and appreciate ethical and community-minded law enforcement officers. We RESIST brutality, lawlessness, and lack of accountability by ICE.

This rally is part of a campaign of recurring “pop-up” rallies at various locations throughout Onondaga County Saturdays 11-12pm. New weekly location will be announced every Monday for that Friday. Raise your voice with a community of protectors of the Constitution and human rights by peacefully assembling together to exercise our First Amendment rights!

In the influential footsteps of Gandhi,  Dr. King, Thich Nhat Hahn, and Susan B Anthony, non-violence is not only a strategy for direct action to save our democracy, but a shared value in our personal conduct. We are a peaceful, yet assertive movement. Any suggestion otherwise is propaganda. We denounce political violence in the clearest and strongest possible terms. 

Additionally, we are an organization of VOLUNTEER activists, organizers, concerned community members, and other protectors of our Constitution. We care about our community and our country. We RESIST authoritarianism from the megalomaniac in the White House. We are NOT paid. Any suggestion otherwise is propaganda. 

In solidarity,

Chad</p>

<h3>Act Local&apos;s Weekly Rally, ICE OUT!</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, January 31, 2026 at 5:00 PM UTC - 5:30 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Old East Street School near CVS<br>50 East St<br>New Milford, CT 06776</p>

<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Please join us! We must stand up against this tyranny! 

Every Saturday our Indivisible group holds a peaceful rally and food/diaper/toiletries drive in New Milford at Noon. Larger sized diapers are most needed and fresh shelf stable vegetables like potatoes, onions, apples, carrots and garlic are always a treat. This week we’re at 50 East St due to a funeral across from the Green. 

Please bring your most peaceful attitude even in these tense times! Avoid spelling out curse words on signs an instead use *#* for vowels. Do not engage with the haters - we do not yell back at them. We ignore, just smile, or give them the peace sign.</p>

<h3>Stop the Violence</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, January 31, 2026 at 5:00 PM UTC - 6:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Veterans Memorial Centre Park<br>514 W Main St<br>Cobleskill, NY 12043</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible for Schoharie County</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>On Saturday, Jan. 24, CPB agents in Minneapolis shot and killed another American citizen. Alex Pretti was a 37-year old ICU nurse at a VA hospital. He was shot on a Minneapolis street because he went to the aid of a woman being roughed up by CPB agents.

This kind of brutal violence that ICE and CPB are inflicting on the streets of America must stop. We will not rest until there is real justice and until ICE and CBP are out of our communities for good.

Join us and demand an end to state sanctioned violence! 

DRESS WARMLY and bring signs!

*A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action and no civil disobedience. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values, and to act lawfully at these events. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events.*</p>

<h3>The People’s Day Protest</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Monday, February 16, 2026 at 5:00 PM UTC - 6:30 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Falls Park on the Reedy<br>601 S Main St<br>Greenville, SC 29601</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Upstate SC</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>On Presidents’ Day, we will protest then gather for a rally in the park to remind our community that We the People are the government. Our leaders are public servants, elected to protect us, represent us, and act in our best interests. This day is not about glorifying power, it is about remembering where power belongs, with the people. 
Across South Carolina, legislators are advancing policies that serve political ambition rather than the people. This protest is a call to expose that betrayal and remind those in office that their loyalty must be to the public, not authoritarian agendas.

Right now, controversial legislation moving through hearings includes near total abortion restrictions, efforts to close open primaries and limit voter choice, attacks on transgender students’ rights, mandates expanding ICE cooperation by local law enforcement, and changes to judicial selection that threaten court independence.

The People’s Day Protest is about dissent, accountability, and action. We refuse to be silent while democracy is weakened. We stand together to say clearly, we will not surrender our rights or our power.
This is our moment to rise, to contact our representatives, to get involved, and to make our voices impossible to ignore.

On Presidents’ Day, we choose the people. We choose freedom. We choose to dissent.</p>

<h3>Indivisible Albany&apos;s Forum on the Police State: What the Flock?</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Monday, February 9, 2026 at 11:00 PM UTC - 1:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Love Albany Center<br>8 Kate St<br>Albany, NY 12209</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Join Indivisible Albany as we kick off our first meeting of 2026 with a forum on the rise of the Police State in America.

Over the past several decades, the United States has experienced a steady and often quiet expansion of surveillance that has reshaped the relationship between the government and the public. What began as targeted intelligence gathering has evolved into a vast ecosystem of data collection, enabled by digital technologies, private-sector partnerships, and national security policies that prioritize preemption over transparency. A striking example of this shift is the rapid adoption of automated license plate reader systems produced by Flock Safety, now deployed by thousands of police departments, public and private entities across the country. The Capital District has seen a rise in the use of Flock cameras, including within the City of Albany, often without meaningful public consent or oversight.

We will discuss how Flock camera systems work, where they are, how the data is retained and, more importantly, how this data is being funneled to federal agencies such as ICE to target and track immigrant communities. We will also discuss actions that you can take to fight back against the installation of Flock cameras and demand accountability for those already in use.</p>

<h3>We the People Dissent Bi-Monthly Grand Circus Protest THEMED: ABOLISH ICE</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Sunday, February 1, 2026 at 6:00 PM UTC - 7:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Grand Circus Park<br><br>Détroit, MI 48226</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>2/1 THEME: ABOLISH ICE.
Join us for an hour of action at Grand Circus Park in Downtown Detroit. Let&apos;s give the resistance in Detroit some good visibility, educate people about the democratic crisis we are deep in with flyering and conversations. We have banners, but feel free to bring your best sign! Make sure you come with water and a snack in your backpack, warm gloves, several layers of sweaters under your winter coat, long johns, scarf, and winter hat. Heated socks sound like a good idea too.

At 1PM, we will start at the corner of Adams &amp; Woodward, just next to Central Methodist Church. We may decide to move to a different corner depending on where the crowd flows, but the meeting point at 1 PM is just outside the Church!

On Sundays, street parking is free. If you cannot find street parking available near Grand Circus, we recommend that you drive up Woodward a bit, where you can park anywhere for free, then hop on the Q-Line (free too!) to Grand Circus. 

*A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*</p>

<h3>ICE OUT OF HOME DEPOT</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, January 31, 2026 at 5:00 PM UTC - 6:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Home Depot<br>2500 Cambridge Rd<br>Schenectady, NY 12304</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Progressive Schenectady</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Home Depot continues its collaboration with ICE.  Stand in solidarity with day laborers and demand that Home Depot ban ICE from staging on its property and end its partnership with ICE!

We&apos;ll be on the sidewalk, by the street, not on private property.  At our previous events at this location, drivers stopped to ask what we were doing and were receptive to our message.

Cambridge Road ends a few short blocks away in a residential area, where there&apos;s ample on-street parking.

Dress warmly!  Bring a sign, and bring a friend.

This is a non-violent, non-confrontational event, intended to put pressure on the local Home Depot and educate folks who stop to talk to us.  If anyone heckles us, ignore him or her.</p>

<h3>Citizens Bank: STOP FUNDING DHS PRISONS</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 7, 2026 at 4:00 PM UTC - 5:30 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Citizens Bank<br>354 Broad St<br>Manchester, CT 06040</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Quiet Corner Indivisible-CT</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>ICE relies on private prison companies to build and operate their inhumane immigration detention facilities. Those private prison companies, in turn, rely on financial institutions -- institutions like Citizens Bank. Citizens Bank is complicit in the evils of the private prison industry; we want to persuade them that this is bad for business, and that a &apos;community bank&apos; shouldn&apos;t be supporting immigration jails.

We&apos;ll gather on the public sidewalk in front of the Citizens Bank branch at 354 Broad Street in Manchester CT on February 7, from 11:00-12:30. Cancellation only for severe weather. Please park nearby, e.g. in the larger shopping area down/across the street (near Ollie&apos;s), rather than parking in the bank parking lot.

Please bring signs specific to this action: Cages Aren&apos;t Communities; Citizens Bank - Stop Financing ICE Prisons; Citizens Bank + ICE = Human Rights Abuse; ICE Prisons - Bad For Communities; Citizens Bank- Divest From ICE; Your Deposits Support Private Prisons, etc. Use your imagination, but please stay on topic.

Notorious private prison companies The GEO Group and CoreCivic are expected to be part of an unprecedented expansion in capacity as part of the Trump administration&apos;s mass detention, deportation, and surveillance policies.

To accommodate this planned increase in detention capacity, GEO and CoreCivic must undertake expensive construction and renovation projects. Since 2019, though, most of their lenders have cut ties with the two companies, which have faced allegations ranging from forced labor to securities fraud.​

In sharp contrast, ​Citizens Bank has embraced its growing relationship with the private prison industry, taking on new roles in financing both CoreCivic and GEO -- all the while advertising their commitment to strengthening our communities.

A core principle behind this event is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values and to act lawfully at these events. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events. Please do not block business entrances or traffic.</p>

<h3>ICE OUT! Walkout and March (Organized by KCS Students)</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Friday, January 30, 2026 at 2:30 PM UTC - 4:30 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Worlds Fair Park<br>800 Worlds Fair Park Dr<br>Knoxville, TN 37902</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Knoxville</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>*STUDENT ORGANIZED BUT ALL ARE INVITED*

Knox County Schools high school students are pushing back against I.C.E. threats and actions in their schools and communities! They have organized this action for the January 30th deadline for Senate to approve the DHS funding bill or trigger a shutdown. 

From the students:

•••

WE&apos;RE SKIPPING OUR LESSONS TO TEACH YOU ONE.

Protect students. Not ICE. You can&apos;t claim to support &quot;every child&quot; if you don&apos;t protect any child. Our schools. Our safety. Our right to be here.
Our education means nothing if our safety and our community are at risk. We aren&apos;t just the leaders of tomorrow, we are the voices of today. When the system prioritizes enforcement over people, it&apos;s our job to demand a change.

•••

- WHEN: Friday, January 30th, 9:30am.

- WHERE: Assemble near the World&apos;s Fair Park Amphitheater and then march together to the City-County Building.

- WHAT: Dress for walking and the frigid cold. Bring water and signs; signs might be about ICE, immigration, government overreach, safety, funding, remembering the 6 people shot or killed by ICE/CBP in 2026, defunding ICE, shutdown, etc.

- NOTE: If you have mobility concerns, please feel free to go straight to the City-County Building Lawn at 430 Main St SW, Knoxville, TN 37902.

Indivisible Knoxville is co-sponsoring this event at the organizers&apos; request.</p>

<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>10 Mile Road &amp; Coolidge Highway<br>Oak Park, MI 48237</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Oak Park Concerned Citizens</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>We are inviting you to join us at a candlelight vigil to memorialize and honor those who have died in ICE detention, those who have died at the hands of ICE on our city streets, and the countless whom ICE has disappeared.  This vigil is a space for mourning, remembrance, and solidarity with the families and communities who continue to carry this loss. By gathering together, we affirm the dignity of every life and bear witness to the human cost of these policies.  We will say their names.

Date: Monday, February 2

Time:  5:30-6:30 pm

Location:   10 Mile &amp; Coolidge, Southeast corner

Vigil candles will be provided, but with the understanding that they might not withstand the mild wind expected that evening.  We encourage everyone to either bring a backup flashlight or battery candle, or use the flashlight on your phones.  We will provide luminaries to border our circle.  We will also provide a few poems to be read by those who are willing.  Feel free to bring anything appropriate for a vigil that you would like to read.
  
If you decide to attend, please dress for the weather.  Consider multiple, multiple layers;  foot and handwarmers; balaclava, scarf or neck gator.  We want everyone to be safe, while showing solidarity for those in Minnesota who have withstood subzero temps during their recent candlelight vigils.   

For those who are interested in streetside protesting during daylight hours, feel free to do so between 4:30-5:30 pm.  However, the vigil will begin at 5:30 pm, at which time any protesting will end.</p>

<h3>RESCHEDULED!: CITIZENS BANK: STOP FUNDING ICE PRISONS!</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, January 31, 2026 at 4:00 PM UTC - 5:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Public Sidewalk Near Citizens Bank - Main Street, Springfield<br>950 Main St<br>Springfield, MA 01103</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Rise Up Western Mass Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>EVENT RESCHEDULED: We had planned to keep our event on this Saturday, even with the single digit temps...but then last night we got a wind-chill warning for dangerous exposure AND with the impending storm, even the heartiest of us will want some time to prepare, so we are postponing our (Springfield, MA) event to the same time next Saturday, 1/31.

Citizens Bank publicly presents itself as a community-centered institution committed to social responsibility. Yet the bank continues to maintain key financial relationships with CoreCivic and The GEO Group: two notorious, for-profit, prison corporations that build and operate immigration detention facilities for ICE, provide transportation services to ICE, and operate prisons for mass incarceration. For more information about Citizens Bank’s relationship to the private prison system, go to boycottcitizens.org.

In response, a coalition of progressive organizations from Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and beyond will hold peaceful, coordinated standouts near regional Citizens Bank branches on Saturday, January 24, 2026. 

An interactive map of participating locations is available here:  https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=1AqRhnn9dpUufZYdnkwFm6cDhqDWM6Tc&amp;ll=42.47280688951886%2C-71.8565222&amp;z=9

Bring your signs: 
Cages Aren’t Communities
De-ICE Citizens Bank
Citizens Bank: Invest in Communities, Not Cages
End Mass Incarceration
Say NO to CoreCivic and The GEO Group
No Banks for Cages

People Over Prison Profits
The coalition calls upon Citizens Bank to live up to its stated values by publicly committing to end its financial relationships with private prison and detention contractors as soon as legally possible. These actions are intended to send a clear message: corporations and financial institutions that enable harmful immigration and detention policies must be held accountable by the communities they claim to serve.

A core principle behind all of these events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values and to act lawfully at these events. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events. Please do not block business entrances or traffic.</p>

Please only bring signs specific to this action: De-ICE Citizens Bank; Cages Aren&apos;t Communities; Citizens Bank - Stop Financing ICE Prisons; Citizens Bank + ICE = Human Rights Abuse; ICE Prisons Don&apos;t Strengthen Our Communities; Citizens Bank- Cut Ties With ICE Prisons; etc. We&apos;ll try to have some extras too.

Notorious private prison companies The GEO Group and CoreCivic are being called on to be part of an unprecedented expansion in capacity as part of the Trump administration&apos;s mass detention, deportation, and surveillance policies. 

To accommodate the planned increase in detention capacity, GEO and CoreCivic must undertake expensive construction and renovation projects. Since 2019, though, most of their lenders have cut ties with the two companies, which have faced allegations from forced labor to securities fraud.​

​Citizens Bank has instead deepened its relationship with the private prison industry, taking on new roles in financing both CoreCivic and GEO, all while continuing to tell their customers that they&apos;re focused on strengthening our communities.

We won&apos;t quietly stand by as Citizens continues to finance the private prison &amp; ICE detention companies that are harming our communities. The 2019 exodus of banks from the industry in response to activism should be a reminder to us that our voices matter. Now it&apos;s time to use them.

<h3>Home Depot--Say NO to ICE, (New location!)</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, January 31, 2026 at 5:00 PM UTC - 6:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>25 Russell St<br>Hadley, MA 01035</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Northampton-Swing Left Western MA</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>We&apos;re continuing our Home Depot standouts--but we are combining forces with our friends who are standing out at the same time down the road, also protesting the treatment of migrant workers.  So please join us there!

Please bring signs specific to not buying from Home Depot.  And please sign up--if the weather turns out to be terrible, we can let you know if we have to cancel.
 
ICE has been targeting Home Depot parking lots across the country, where day labor people (often immigrants) gather to pick up work.  ICE just swoops in and grabs people.  Home Depot&apos;s response--silence.   So we are telling people to boycott Home Depot until they tell ICE to stay out of their parking lots (which are their private property.)</p>

<h3>ICE OUT FOR GOOD Call/Email Campaign</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Friday, January 30, 2026 at 5:00 AM UTC - 4:45 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> NE Oakland Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>## Congress must write a DHS appropriations bill that puts serious restrictions on ICE, ends its dragnet raids, and doesn’t add a penny to its already bloated budget. 

### Every MoC must publicly oppose a DHS appropriations bill that fails to meet this moment! CALL AND WRITE THEM DAILY

Tell Senator [Gary Peters](https://www.peters.senate.gov/contact/email-gary)  202-224-6221

Tell Senator [Elissa Slotkin](https://www.slotkin.senate.gov/contact/contact-senator-slotkin/) 202-224-4822

Tell MI09 Representative [Lisa McClain](https://mcclain.house.gov/contact) 202-225-2106

Not in MI09? call the Capitol Switchboard 202-224-3121


▶️ **We are outraged by the killing of Alex Pretti and Renee Good by ICE and Border Patrol. We grieve their deaths and the deaths of all those killed in ICE detention.**


▶️ **ICE has been escalating its cruel deployments into our communities.** *This recent killing is not an isolated incident, but the devastating and predictable result of ICE’s lawless operations and President Trump’s abuse of power.*


▶️ **We demand accountability and not one penny more for ICE.** *Congress must reject funding increases in the DHS appropriations bill and rein in ICE and Border Patrol.*


**The Bill MUST**


▶️ **Strengthen restrictions on ICE and Border Patrol’s ability to conduct dragnet arrest operations and target people based on their race, language or accent, place of employment, or location at the time of the apprehension.** *These agencies have secretively created a mass surveillance apparatus that uses dragnet techniques to forcibly collect and track biometric data on American citizens and immigrants alike without any legislative, judicial, or public oversight.*


▶️ **End Border Patrol deployment to our cities and reject its ever-expanding mandate in immigration enforcement.** *Trump’s DHS has been deploying Border Patrol in complex immigration enforcement campaigns in cities far from any border, harassing communities and refusing to communicate with local law enforcement. Trump treats Greg Bovino, the “Commander At Large,” like his personal secret police chief.*


▶️ **Limit DHS’s reprogramming and transfer authority, including specifically preventing reprogramming and transferring funds for detention.** *This prohibits DHS from continuing to move money around to fuel ICE and Border Patrol lawlessness. We can’t trust that funds meant to be used for routine work like customs paperwork won’t be reallocated for dangerous detention centers or weapons of war used on our communities.*


▶️ **Deny the Trump regime’s demands for increased DHS funding.** *ICE alone already has a budget bigger than most countries’ militaries. No reforms, as necessary as they are, could justify funneling even more taxpayer dollars to Trump’s secret police and mass deportation machine.*

<h3>CITIZENS BANK: STOP FINANCING ICE PRISONS!</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, January 31, 2026 at 4:00 PM UTC - 5:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Sidewalk along Upper Glen Street in front of Queensbury Plaza<br>756 Upper Glen St<br>Queensbury, NY 12804</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible ADK/Saratoga</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>## POSTPONED TO SATURDAY, JANUARY 31.   

Citizens Bank publicly presents itself as a community-centered institution committed to social responsibility, yet the bank continues to maintain key financial relationships with CoreCivic and The GEO Group: two notorious, for-profit, prison corporations that support ICE.  

In response, a coalition of progressive organizations across the Northeast will hold peaceful, coordinated standouts near regional Citizens Bank branches. Our event will be a **Honk-n-Wave**. 🚗👋🏻

🚗**Parking:** please park around the vacant red building near Staples, south of the entrance into the Queensbury Plaza shopping center. 

**For this action, please keep your signs focused on these messages**:   
📢Cages Aren’t Communities  
📢De-ICE Citizens Bank  
📢Citizens Bank: Invest in Communities, Not Cages  
📢End Mass Incarceration  
📢Say NO to CoreCivic and The GEO Group  
📢No Banks for Cages  
📢People Over Prison Profits  

**Join *We Rise Saturday* immediately following this event** to bring signs with your other powerful messages. (This is a weekly vigil held from 12-1pm at the Civil War Monument in Glens Falls, just a couple miles down the road.)  

*A core principle behind all the DE-ICE Citizens Bank events is a **commitment to nonviolent action**. We expect all participants to seek to **de-escalate** any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values and to act lawfully at these events. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events. **Please do not block the bus stop or pedestrian/vehicular traffic.***

&gt; Learn more about Citizens Bank’s relationship to the private prison system:  

&gt; CoreCivic and The GEO Group build and operate immigration detention facilities for ICE, provide transportation services to ICE, and operate prisons for mass incarceration. Go to boycottcitizens.org or contact the De-ICE Coalition at de.ICE.CitizensBank@gmail.com.  

&gt; The coalition calls upon Citizens Bank to live up to its stated values by publicly committing to end its financial relationships with private prison and detention contractors as soon as legally possible. These actions are intended to send a clear message: corporations and financial institutions that enable harmful immigration and detention policies must be held accountable by the communities they claim to serve.

JOIN YOUR NEIGHBORS ~ USE YOUR VOICE!

## EVERY Friday, from 3:00-4:00 on most overpasses. ##

**Please check weather conditions beforehand.** Overpasses may not be clear of ice and snow during winter months. Please only stand and hang banners if conditions are safe to do so.

Freedom for All. Justice for All. NO KINGS.

If you believe in Demanding Due Process for All

If you believe in the Power of Free Speech and Peaceful Protest

If you believe in Remaining a Democracy instead of having a King

If you believe in Having an Efficient, Effective government that Respects its Citizens

If you believe ICE is NOT immune from following the LAW

If you believe we&apos;ve shed Enough Blood for Oil and Power

If you believe the Epstein Files need to be released NOW

**NOW is the time to voice your concern. Join Us in Protest of What&apos;s Happening!**

Exit 2 is the only overpass where many protesters with signs are appropriate. Other overpasses are better for banners and flags and fewer people BUT we do welcome people to come to other overpasses and share the energy!


- Tyler Hill Road I-91 overpass
- Western Ave Exit 2, South side of the I-91 bridge overpass - Please do not park or stand anywhere near the Deli OR block ANY driveways. PLEASE Respect Our Neighbors!
- Black Mountain Rd. I-91 overpass
- I-91 bridge overpass Putney Exit 4 – Please do not park in local business parking lots.

Bring Yourself, a Friend, your Kids, a Sign, a Banner on POSTS, a Flag or Upside down flag to support your community!

Voice your opposition to the threat on OUR Democracy, our Community and our Environment!

These protests are Self-Policed.  Please keep yourself and your fellow protesters safe. Stay alert.  

**A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.**

<h3>CITIZENS BANK: STOP FUNDING ICE PRISONS! Hosted by Grafton Indivisible and GAIN</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, January 31, 2026 at 4:00 PM UTC - 5:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Citizens Bank<br>100 Worcester St<br>Grafton, MA 01519</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> GAIN - Greater Assabet Indivisible Network</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Citizens Bank publicly presents itself as a community-centered institution committed to social responsibility. Yet the bank continues to maintain key financial relationships with CoreCivic and The GEO Group: two notorious, for-profit, prison corporations that build and operate immigration detention facilities for ICE, provide transportation services to ICE, and operate prisons for mass incarceration. For more information about Citizens Bank’s relationship to the private prison system, go to boycottcitizens.org or contact the De-ICE Coalition at de.ICE.CitizensBank@gmail.com.

In response, a coalition of progressive organizations from Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and beyond will hold peaceful, coordinated standouts near regional Citizens Bank branches on Saturday, January 24, 2026. 

Grafton Indivisible and Greater Assabet Indivisible Network (GAIN), and other local groups, are hosting the action at the Citizen&apos;s Branch at 100 Worcester St., Grafton, MA.

An interactive map of participating locations is available here:  https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=1AqRhnn9dpUufZYdnkwFm6cDhqDWM6Tc&amp;ll=42.47280688951886%2C-71.8565222&amp;z=9

The coalition calls upon Citizens Bank to live up to its stated values by publicly committing to end its financial relationships with private prison and detention contractors as soon as legally possible. These actions are intended to send a clear message: corporations and financial institutions that enable harmful immigration and detention policies must be held accountable by the communities they claim to serve.

A core principle behind all of these events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values and to act lawfully at these events. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events. Please do not block business entrances or traffic.</p>

        <name>National Day of Lobbying: Impeach, Convict, and Remove Radcliff, KY (KY-02)</name>
        <description><![CDATA[
<h3>National Day of Lobbying: Impeach, Convict, and Remove Radcliff, KY (KY-02)</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, February 17, 2026 at 7:00 PM UTC - 9:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Rep Guthrie’s Hardin County Regional Office<br>411 W Lincoln Trail Blvd<br>Radcliff, KY 40160</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> 50501Missouri</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>In the first week of 2026, the administration engaged in three flagrant abuses of power: (1) an unconstitutional military strike in Venezuela, (2) the extrajudicial murder of Renee Nicole Good by a member of the ICE paramilitary force for exercising her first amendment rights, and (3) the continued obstruction of justice for victims of Jeffrey Epstein’s child sex trafficking ring. A month into 2026, the administration has escalated their unchecked aggression against allies like Greenland and countries like Cuba, Columbia, and Mexico. ICE has kidnapped preschoolers and used them as bait for their parents, and the administration is considering deploying military police to back them up.

In short: It’s not getting better and Congress is not meeting the moment. 

Democracy does not defend itself; it requires the active participation of the people. While countless Americans have already called, emailed, written letters, signed petitions, and while activist organizations have brought groups to Capitol Hill calling for impeachment, this moment demands something more visible, more direct, and more powerful: constituents showing up at congressional district offices, where staff rarely, if ever, engage with constituents.

Impeachment is not optional. It is the remedy mandated by the Constitution.

WHO/WHEN:

FLARE USA, Citizens&apos; Impeachment, and 50501 Movement are proud to announce the next National Day of Action: in-district lobbying on February 17, 2026 for the impeachment, conviction, and removal of President Trump. Representatives will be in their districts; catch them at home and demand they use their power to remove this unconstitutional regime!

Grassroots pro-democracy organizations (e.g., local chapters of Indivisible, Hands Off, 50501), progressive primary candidates, and other concerned citizens will join together in leading constituents into the local/in-district offices of all 435 US House Representatives to demand impeachment. 

Please see our attendee guide for more information on why we&apos;re mobilizing, specific goals, current news on impeachment, and a full guide, including scripts, for visiting and following up with your Representative&apos;s office at tinyurl.com/lobby217guide. 

By registering for the event, you are agreeing that event partners may receive your contact information and communicate with you about related activities. 

All participants are committed to lawful, non-violent action and no civil disobedience.</p>

<h3>Get ICE out of Home Depot Natick WEEKLY Saturdays @ 1pm Sponsored by MBIC</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, January 31, 2026 at 6:00 PM UTC - 7:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Cochituate Road<br>Cochituate Rd &amp; Speen Street<br>Framingham, MA 01701</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Metro Boston Indivisible Coaltion</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>NOTE: Due to Frigid temperatures SAT 1/24 Event is Cancelled.

We will cancel If temperature is &lt; 32 degrees OR winter storm warnings

WEEKLY SATURDAYS at 1-2 pm Natick Home Depot Cochituate Rd


Standing out Home Depot Natick Cochituate Rd entrance sending a clear message to stop allowing ICE raids on their property and to boycott shopping there! Tell the Trump administration we don&apos;t stand for illegal deportations!

All over the country, ICE agents are targeting immigrants in and around Home Depot, and these atrocities are happening on Home Depot’s watch, on its properties, with its silence.

The Home Depot has not publicly resisted or condemned these raids or demanded that the Administration stop assaulting and abducting people on and outside its properties. With its silence and inaction, Home Depot has become ICE’s passive partner. 

In order to show up for immigrant community members and defeat authoritarianism, we must engage in the dual strategy of electing people who will stand up to Trump, and engaging in noncooperation (also known as civil resistance). Movements with no civil resistance actions, stopping democratic backsliding only happens 7.5% of the time. With a civil resistance added to the movement, that percentage goes up to 51.7%! 

In addition to this, we need to run civil resistance campaigns that hit the power holders where it hurts! When we do symbolic actions like one day protests and vigils, which are useful in their own way, power holders can easily ignore them. When we engage in actions that cost money like a boycott, cost elected leaders their seats, or stop business as usual, they are far more likely to respond. So we engage in noncooperation because we must impose real and tangible costs to powerholders&apos; bottom-lines!

A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.

Suggested signs:
ICE out of Home Depot 
We Ain’t Buying it - stand with immigrant neighbors! 
If you work with ICE, we freeze our spending</p>

<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>The St Lawrence County Sheriff&apos;s Office is pushing a Section 287(g) Memorandum of Agreement with ICE.
We already have verified reports of the county sheriffs working with ICE and now they want to officially partner with ICE, who has been going door to door in multiple states to abduct people from their homes.
We must stand up to protect our neighbors from ICE! Join us at the St Lawrence County Board of Legislators Monthly Meeting on Feb 2 to demand our representatives not cave to the pressure or the bribery of this agreement with a rogue agency kidnapping and murdering US citizens, or anyone at all.

This a local Indivisible event!

<h3>Citizens Bank: Stop Financing ICE Prisons!</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 7, 2026 at 4:00 PM UTC - 5:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Public sidewalks near three Citizens Bank branches in Cambridge MA:  Central Square, 689 Massachusetts Ave, 02139 // Harvard Square, 30 Brattle St. 02138 // Porter Square, 822 Somerville Ave, 02140<br>30 Brattle St<br>Cambridge, MA 02138</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Progressive Mass Cambridge</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>This event is organized locally by the Cambridge chapter of the regional De-ICE Citizens Bank Coalition. 

Citizens Bank publicly presents itself as a community-centered institution committed to social responsibility. Yet the Bank continues to maintain key financial relationships with CoreCivic and The GEO Group, two notorious, for-profit, prison corporations that build and operate immigration detention facilities for ICE, provide transportation services to ICE, and operate prisons for mass incarceration. 

For more details about Citizens Bank’s relationship to the private prison system, go to boycottcitizens.org 

In response, the De-ICE Citizens Bank Coalition (de.ICE.CitizensBank@gmail.com), presently comprising progressive organizations from MA, CT, VT, RI, NY, NJ, PA, DE, and DC, is holding informational standouts near Citizens Bank branches.

The Coalition calls upon Citizens Bank to live up to its stated values by publicly committing to end its financial relationships with private prison and detention contractors as soon as legally possible. These actions are intended to send a clear message: corporations and financial institutions that enable harmful immigration and detention policies must be held accountable by the communities they claim to serve.

We&apos;ll stand out on the public sidewalks at Citizens Banks with signs and informational leaflets.  We will urge Citizens Bank customers to contact their local branch managers and relevant executives of the Bank about the investments in ICE and to tell Citizens they may be closing their accounts.

Please only bring signs specific to this action, such as: 
Citizens Bank: Stop Financing ICE Prisons! // ICE Cages Aren&apos;t “Communities” // Citizens Bank + ICE = Human Rights Abuse // “Strengthen Our Communities”? Not with ICE Prisons! // Citizens Bank: Cut Ties With ICE.

We&apos;ll have some extra signs.

Dress for the weather. Bring hand/foot warmers if you need them. Unless it is unsafe, we plan to be out in solidarity with activists around the country who won&apos;t let weather deter them! Sign Up to be notified of any cancellation. 

A core principle behind all of these events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values and to act lawfully at these events. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events. Please do not block business entrances or traffic.</p>

<h3>Ride for Our Republic</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, January 31, 2026 at 7:00 PM UTC - 9:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Copley Square<br>560 Boylston St<br>Boston, MA 02116</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>On Saturday January 31st, cyclists are meeting in Copley Square at 2pm to ride at 2:30pm in solidarity with the courageous people of Minnesota who have shown up for each other. This is not an official #Ride4Republic event, but we will be there to honor, mourn, and stand up for Alex Pretti, Renee Good, Liam Conejo Ramos, and all harmed by the violence of ICE.

And remember if you see ICE, CALL LUCE HOTLINE: 617-370-5023 and keep our neighbors safe! 
------------------------------------------------------

Ride for Our Republic is a recurring pro-democracy bike ride held on the last Saturday of each month April-October 2025. In the spirit of Paul Revere and on the 250th anniversary of the first American Revolution, we ride to sound the alarm of tyranny and fight for our democracy.

Fascism cannot flourish where joy and solidarity thrive. That truth is the heartbeat of Ride for Our Republic: a growing community of cyclists reclaiming Boston’s streets and bike paths as spaces of protest, hope, and joyful resistance. 

Please follow our facebook page: www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100088170471304

Check back for rides leading up to No Kings March Saturday, March 31st! 

Our monthly #Ride4Republic bike protests will restart on Patriot&apos;s Day in April 2026.
We’ll ride a 12.7-mile route (bike paths + roads), but you’re welcome to join or leave at the waypoints where we rally and connect.

Route:
Boston → Davis Sq (3.9 mi)
Davis Sq → Arlington Center (3.8 mi)
Arlington Center → Lexington Center (5 mi)

10:00am – Meet at Paul Revere Park near the playground (North Washington St., Charlestown) – rain or shine

10:45–11:00am – 7 Hills Park, Davis Square, Somerville behind the T station

11:30–11:45am – Uncle Sam Statue, Arlington Center

Ending Point – Lexington Center, Minuteman Bikeway 

Bring: bright colors or neon, pro-democracy costumes or signs (bike frame, basket, shirt, or bag), American flags, and No Kings signs. 

Don’t forget water, snacks, packed lunch, sunscreen, bike lock, and other ride supplies.

Yours in Solidarity and Joyful Resistance,

Ride for Our Republic</p>

        <name>National Day of Lobbying: Impeach, Convict, and Remove Boston</name>
        <description><![CDATA[
<h3>National Day of Lobbying: Impeach, Convict, and Remove Boston</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, February 17, 2026 at 2:00 PM UTC - 12:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br><br>Boston, MA 02108</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> 50501Missouri</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Please note this event is not finalized. Details will be provided as the event takes shape. Time and location are subject to change.

In the first week of 2026, the administration engaged in three flagrant abuses of power: (1) an unconstitutional military strike in Venezuela, (2) the extrajudicial murder of Renee Nicole Good by a member of the ICE paramilitary force for exercising her first amendment rights, and (3) the continued obstruction of justice for victims of Jeffrey Epstein’s child sex trafficking ring. 

Impeachment is not optional. It is the remedy mandated by the Constitution.

FLARE USA, Citizens&apos; Impeachment, and 50501 Movement are proud to announce the next National Day of Action: in-district lobbying on February 17, 2026 for the impeachment, conviction, and removal of President Trump. Representatives will be in their districts; catch them at home and demand they use their power to remove this unconstitutional regime!

Grassroots pro-democracy organizations (e.g., local chapters of Indivisible, Hands Off, 50501), progressive primary candidates, and other concerned citizens will join together in leading constituents into the local/in-district offices of all 435 US House Representatives to demand impeachment. 

All participants are committed to lawful, non-violent action and no civil disobedience. 

Further training materials to follow soon.</p>

<h3>Indivisible SCI General Meeting Feb. 2026</h3>

<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Monroe County Public Library - Ellettsville Branch<br>600 W Temperance St<br>Ellettsville, IN 47429</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible South Central Indiana</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>**Our February meeting will now feature special guest speaker Sheriff Ruben Marté, rescheduled from our snowed-out January meeting.** 

The &quot;Refugees 101&quot; training from Exodus Refugee Immigration originally planned for the February meeting will be rescheduled for sometime in March, exact date TBD.

Please arrive by 2:45pm so we can get everyone signed in and start the meeting promptly at 3:00pm.

### Guest Speaker
We will be joined by Sheriff Ruben Marté to hear his vision for law enforcement in Monroe County. Marté has been protecting the rights of our immigrant neighbors by refusing to honor unconstitutional ICE holds.

### In-Meeting Action
Our friends from Exodus Refugee Immigration, Inc. will update us on immigration-related legislation currently active in the Indiana statehouse and actions you can take to support good bills and oppose those that harm our immigrant neighbors.

### ISCI Photography &amp; Video Policy
ISCI may take photos or videos at meetings and events to document, share, and promote our activities. When taking photos or videos, ISCI representatives will do their best to seek explicit consent before photographing individuals with their faces or names visible. We ask all participants taking personal photos or videos to seek consent as well and respect the wishes of those who do not want to be photographed or recorded. **Please note that in public settings, including protests, there is always the possibility of being identifiably photographed.** Ultimately, the responsibility for protecting our identity lies with each of us individually. If you are concerned about being photographed or recorded during Indivisible activities, we strongly encourage you to cover your face and other identifiable features.</p>

<h3>JUSTICE FOR ALEX PRETTI RALLY ✊✊</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, January 31, 2026 at 4:00 PM UTC - 5:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Odell Veterans Memorial Park<br>56-98 Broadway<br>Beverly, MA 01915</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> May Day Strong</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Friday, January 24th, an American citizen, Alex Pretti was killed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Minneapolis, Minnesota. This killing is part of a broader pattern of unchecked violence, impunity, and abuse carried out by federal immigration enforcement agencies against members of our communities.

Avelo Airlines has become the first commercial airline to contract with ICE for secretive deportation flights—flights with no guarantees of due process or legal counsel. We’re organizing nationwide to make it politically and publicly impossible for them to keep profiting from human rights abuses. Our targets include the airports where Avelo operates, universities that may have ongoing partnerships with Avelo, and states and localities subsidizing them with public dollars. Whether you’re planning a protest, a teach-in, a visibility action, or a meeting with decision-makers, your event is part of a growing movement to force Avelo to cancel its ICE contract and to send a clear message to every other corporation: if you cooperate with deportation, you’ll face consequences.

A core principle behind all events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values. We expect hosts to ensure all participants in your event uphold this commitment.</p>

<h3>JUSTICE FOR ALEX PRETTI RALLY + STANDOUT</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, January 31, 2026 at 4:00 PM UTC - 5:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Odell Veterans Memorial Park<br>56-98 Broadway<br>Beverly, MA 01915</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Swing Left</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Friday, January 24th, an American citizen, Alex Pretti was killed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Minneapolis, Minnesota. This killing is part of a broader pattern of unchecked violence, impunity, and abuse carried out by federal immigration enforcement agencies against members of our communities.

Avelo Airlines has become the first commercial airline to contract with ICE for secretive deportation flights—flights with no guarantees of due process or legal counsel. We’re organizing nationwide to make it politically and publicly impossible for them to keep profiting from human rights abuses. Our targets include the airports where Avelo operates, universities that may have ongoing partnerships with Avelo, and states and localities subsidizing them with public dollars. Whether you’re planning a protest, a teach-in, a visibility action, or a meeting with decision-makers, your event is part of a growing movement to force Avelo to cancel its ICE contract and to send a clear message to every other corporation: if you cooperate with deportation, you’ll face consequences.

A core principle behind all events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values. We expect hosts to ensure all participants in your event uphold this commitment.</p>

<h3>HANDS OFF GREENLAND 🇬🇱 ICE OUT OF OUR COMMUNITIES [Rally + Standout]</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, March 7, 2026 at 4:00 PM UTC - 5:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Odell Veterans Memorial Park<br>56-98 Broadway<br>Beverly, MA 01915</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Swing Left</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Trump is waging war and committing murder to enrich his billionaire backers. We are fighting to stop him. Stand with us and take action this weekend to demand an end to the occupation of Greenland, Ukraine and our cities.

We’re focusing on corporate targets - companies set to benefit most from the occupation of ICE or Greenland.

We stand united demanding an end to the Greenland occupation and the removal of reckless untrained ICE agents from our communities. And we&apos;re taking our fight to the companies that are backing this administration and benefiting most.

Together we will hit these companies in their pocketbooks, force the administration to end the occupation of Greenland our cities and spread the word to our neighbors that we deserve better.

Every dollar spent in wars overseas or at home is a dollar we paid for with our taxes - a dollar that could and should go to helping our communities thrive. We can have good jobs, better schools, access to healthcare and get our basic needs met. But not while our government works for billionaires and not for us.

Join us, stand strong and speak up.

Please note: A core principle behind all our events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events</p>

<h3>Weekly Protest for an End to ICE in Cherokee County</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, February 3, 2026 at 9:00 PM UTC - 10:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Intersection of Main Street &amp; Hwy 92<br><br>Woodstock, GA 30188</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Cherokee United</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>**ICE enforcement is expanding in plain sight and in silence.**

Across the country—and here in Georgia—ICE operations rely on racial profiling, secrecy, and fear. People are detained without notice. Families are separated. Children are taken from caregivers. Communities are left in the dark while their neighbors disappear from workplaces, homes, and schools.

**This is not about safety.**

**This is about power exercised without accountability.**

When government agencies operate without transparency, targeting vulnerable people while shielding their actions from public scrutiny, democracy erodes at the local level first. What happens to immigrant communities today becomes the blueprint for broader abuse tomorrow.

That’s why we show up. Every week. Together.

** We gather to demand:** 

• No ICE presence in our neighborhoods

• An end to racial profiling and secret enforcement actions

• Transparency, accountability, and community consent

• Public safety rooted in trust—not fear

———

**📍 Intersection of Hwy 92 &amp; Main St, Woodstock, GA**

**🕓 Every Tuesday • 4–5 PM**

**📣 Indivisible Cherokee United – Activism &amp; Mobilization**

_This is a nonviolent, community-centered protest. We organize peacefully._</p>

<h3>Disappeared in America – ICE Protest</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 7, 2026 at 6:00 PM UTC - 7:30 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>9037 GA-92<br>Woodstock, GA 30189</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Across the country, families are being torn apart while billionaires and corporations cash in. This “Disappeared in America” weekend, we’re joining a national action to expose how Trump’s deportation agenda and corporate greed work hand-in-hand—disappearing our neighbors while the powerful profit.

After our regular Saturday Stand, we’ll gather on the public sidewalk in front of Home Depot to demand an end to MAGA’s regime of bullies-for-the-billionaires. Home Depot’s leadership and political donations have helped bankroll extremist candidates and policies that criminalize immigrants, silence workers, and strip away our freedoms.

We’re standing together—Black, brown, and white, native and newcomer—to say every family belongs, and no corporation should profit from fear.

Bring signs calling out deportations, corporate greed, and the billionaires funding Trump’s takeover.
Example signs:
	•	“Stop the Disappearances”
	•	“No Profits from Pain”
	•	“Home Depot: Fund Communities, Not Fascism”
	•	“Families Belong Together—In Woodstock Too”

Join us to defend our freedoms, our families, and our future.

This a local Indivisible event!

<h3>UPDATED! IND Cobb - ICE Out EVERYWHERE @ HD</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, January 31, 2026 at 6:00 PM UTC - 7:30 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Cumberland Parkway SE &amp; Paces Ferry Road SE<br>Vinings, GA 30339</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Cobb</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>ICE continues to escalate their brutality and lawless behavior. We will continue to stand up and send the message ICE Out Everywhere.

We are gathering at the intersection of Cumberland Pkwy SE &amp; Paces Ferry Rd SE to demand that Home Depot end its cooperation with ICE and CBP and stop allowing immigration enforcement to target day laborers on or near its properties.

For years, Home Depot parking lots have functioned as informal hiring sites for day laborers, many of whom are immigrants seeking honest work to support their families. By permitting ICE access to these spaces, Home Depot enables the intimidation, detention, and deportation of workers who are simply trying to survive.

Corporations do not exist outside of moral responsibility. When a company allows its property to be used as a site of immigration enforcement, it becomes complicit in harm - tearing families apart, destabilizing communities, and contributing to fear and exploitation of workers.

Join us in demanding Home Depot:
1.) Publicly call for an immediate end to the ICE “surge” into MN and for ICE and CBP to leave the state;
2.) The officers who killed Renee Good and Alex Pretti must be held legally accountable. Demand legitimate investigations with state involvement.
3.) Exercise their 4th Amendment rights and publicly post signage denying entrance to on-duty immigration agents who do not have signed judicial warrants as required by law, as well train staff on how to respond when immigration agents arrive at stores.
4.) Publicly call for Congress to freeze funding for ICE.

This rally is about dignity, accountability, and the right to seek work without fear. We stand in solidarity with immigrant workers and demand that Home Depot choose people over profit and justice over convenience.

* Please use discretion when choosing where to park. We encourage participants to follow posted signage and local parking regulations, to be respectful of nearby businesses and residents, and to consider patronizing local businesses when possible. *

** The weather is expected to be extremely challenging, but we are MN strong and plan to move forward unless GDOT issues an advisory to stay off the roads. If you plan to attend, please dress appropriately (think Ralphie&apos;s little brother from A Christmas Story) or refer to this link for suggestions: https://www.uchealth.org/today/how-best-to-prevent-frostbite/ **

*** A core principle behind all ICE Out For Good events is a commitment to nonviolent action and no civil disobedience. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values, and to act lawfully at these events. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events. All events should be held in public spaces or on public property. ***</p>

<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Thomas Square Park<br>99 E 35th St<br>Savannah, GA 31404</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> May Day Strong</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Trump is waging war and committing murder to enrich his billionaire backers. We are fighting to stop him. **Stand with us and take action this weekend to demand an end to the occupation of Venezuela and our cities.** 

We’re focusing on corporate targets - companies set to benefit most from the occupation of ICE or Venezuela. 

This week, our target is **Hilton Hotels**, housing this administration&apos;s ICE goons.

**We stand united demanding an end to the Venezuelan occupation and the removal of reckless untrained ICE agents from our communities.** And we&apos;re taking our fight to the companies that are backing this administration and benefiting most.

**Together we will hit these companies in their pocketbooks, force the administration to end the occupation of Venezuela and our cities and spread the word to our neighbors that we deserve better.**

Every dollar spent in wars overseas or at home is a dollar we paid for with our taxes - a dollar that could and should go to helping our communities thrive. We can have good jobs, better schools, access to healthcare and get our basic needs met. But not while our government works for billionaires and not for us.

Join us, stand strong and speak up.

*Please note: A core principle behind all our events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.

<h3>ICE out for Good!  Civil Rights Sundays</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Sunday, February 1, 2026 at 8:00 PM UTC - 9:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Market Square<br>Portsmouth, NH 03801</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Last week, over 1,200 people came out to protest the Murder of Renee Good, with ICE out for Good! and all that is going on! The fascist takeover of our country. The disregard for our Constitution and our laws.
The Murder of Renee Good, despite the attempts to obfuscate, boils down to the fact that nothing she did deserved a death sentence, and ICE was acting as Judge, Jury, and Executioner. Not just Jonothan Ross, but we have seen similar disregard for the law across the country.
Venezuela is still going on, as is the immigration crackdown, and now we have to worry about Iran and attacking our NATO partner, Greenland.
✔ Oppose U.S. war/militarism
✔ Reject regime change and sovereignty violations
✔ Call for peace and respect for international law
Join us at 3! Civil Rights Sundays!
Say No to the military being used against Citizens!
Due Process is being denied to immigrants; it is only a matter of time before it is taken from citizens!

Join us today to save our Democracy!

Build a Democracy that Money Can&apos;t Buy!
Stand up for Democracy!
Stand up for Our Country!
Stand up for Immigrants!
Stand up for History!
Stand up for Equity!

The Hand&apos;s Off and NO KINGS Rallies were awesome but we need to continue!
We stand along the street in front of the North Church, On Congress Street! the Brick Church off of Market Square in Portsmouth!
Everyone is welcome to bring their own signs, We also have signs, banners, and flags to share.
We call the event Civil Rights Sundays, we started in November of 2016 after Trump won the first time, and we were in the square every Sunday until Covid shut us down, then we went back out when Ukraine was invaded and brought back the name Civil Rights Sundays when Roe Vs Wade was overturned.
Please join us at 3 PM!
Call for a continued ceasefire in Gaza and for an end to our administration using our tax dollars to support a holocaust!

- the murder of peaceful observers like Renee Good and Alex Pretti
- the unwelcome occupation of our towns and cities, like Minneapolis
- the detention of immigrant children/the children of immigrants
- the detention of immigrants with no criminal record
- inhumane conditions at detention centers in the US
- sending immigrants to detention centers in foreign countries over which we have little to no oversight
- the overall inhumane and illegal actions taken against immigrants and peaceful resisters under the Trump administration and under ICE occupation

Bring signs, bring your chanting voice, and stand with your community against ICE!</p>

A core principle of all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. Participants are expected to de-escalate any potential confrontation.

On Wednesday, January 7th, an American citizen was killed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Minneapolis, Minnesota. This killing is part of a broader pattern of unchecked violence, impunity, and abuse carried out by federal immigration enforcement agencies against members of our communities. 

A core principle behind all ICE Out For Good events is a commitment to nonviolent action and no civil disobedience. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values, and to act lawfully at these events. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events. All events should be held in public spaces or on public property.

Indivisible is managing data and communications with participants. By registering, you agree to receive info from Indivisible about the event, receive communications via e-mail or SMS message from Indivisible, and receive any other updates and opportunities to take action or support ICE OUT FOR GOOD partner organizations. You also agree to have any data entered in this registration collected by Indivisible. Indivisible will treat your data according to our organization’s applicable privacy policy: https://indivisible.org/privacy-policy</p>

Good Trouble Indivisible&apos;s

ICE OUT: Community Think-Tank is an open, inclusive space for community members to come together to talk, listen, and think critically about what is happening with ICE and immigration enforcement in our cities.

This gathering is not a protest or a lecture. It is a facilitated community conversation designed to:

	•	Share thoughts, concerns, and lived experiences

	•	Discuss the real impacts of ICE activity on families and communities

	•	Brainstorm ideas, actions, and solutions focused on getting ICE out of our cities

	•	Build understanding, solidarity, and community-driven strategies for change

While broader concerns about the current Trump administration and its policies may arise naturally, this Think-Tank will remain intentionally focused on ICE—its role, its impact, and what meaningful community resistance and alternatives can look like.

All are welcome. No prior knowledge or political affiliation is required.
Respectful dialogue and shared humanity are the foundation of this space.

Hosted by: Good Trouble Indivisible
Accessibility: Indoor, seated, warm, and community-centered

This a local Indivisible event!

*A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*</p>

<h3>ICE OUT: COMMUNITY VIGIL | Saugatuck</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Sunday, February 8, 2026 at 10:30 PM UTC - 11:30 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>All Saints Episcapol Church<br>252 Grand St<br>Saugatuck, MI 49453</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>ICE OUT COMMUNITY VIGIL – A Space for Witness, Grief, and Collective Voice

Host Organization:
Good Trouble Indivisible (with community partners)

📍All Saints Episcopal Church (Sanctuary – indoors)
     252 Grand St, Saugatuck, MI 49453

📆 Sunday, February 8, 2026 (and every Sunday evening thereafter)

⏰ 5:30 PM – 6:30 PM | Please allow additional time for a quiet, respectful departure by 7:00 PM.

Event Description:
This is a community-led ICE OUT vigil, held inside the sanctuary of All Saints Episcopal Church—created as a space for reflection, shared grief, witness, and collective care.

This gathering is non-partisan and open to all. People of all backgrounds, beliefs, and political affiliations are welcome. The focus of this vigil is humanitarian, moral, and grounded in shared human dignity.

There will be no featured speakers and no formal program. Instead, the vigil centers the voices of those who attend. Community members are invited—if they choose—to stand and speak from the pulpit or from their seats, sharing how they feel about ICE enforcement practices, including detention, deportation, family separation, brutality, and loss of life.

This is a space to:

	•	Speak names

	•	Speak truth

	•	Bear witness together

	•	Sit with one another in reflection and care

A light facilitation will help maintain a respectful, grounded flow, but the vigil itself belongs to the community.

What to Expect:

	•	Indoor, seated vigil

	•	Quiet, respectful atmosphere

	•	Community sharing (voluntary)

	•	No microphones or amplification

	•	No chanting or movement outside the sanctuary

What This Is / Is Not:

	✔ A vigil, ✖ not a protest

	✔ Non-partisan and community-centered

	✔ Open and welcoming to all

	✔ A space for moral witness and shared humanity

	✖ Not a rally or planning meeting

All are welcome who come in the spirit of respect, reflection, and care for one another.

Please join us in taking a stand against ICE and Fascism.

This march is part of Good Trouble Indivisible’s ongoing regional “SIGNS OF FASCISM” series across West Michigan. This impactful, public awareness march has already taken place twice in Douglas, twice in Saugatuck, and also in Fennville, Holland, and Zeeland — and is now coming back to Saugatuck. Residents are encouraged to join us. (We have combined our ICE OUT FOR GOOD March with our SIGNS OF FASCISM March.)

Good Trouble Indivisible invites you to participate in one of our most powerful nonviolent actions: a silent performance march called SIGNS OF FASCISM will be our first lap through the downtown area. The second lap through the downtown will represent ICE OUT FOR GOOD.

Participants walk silently, in the first lap of our SIGNS OF FASCISM MARCH, single file, through downtown — dressed in all black — each carrying a stark black-and-white sign naming one warning sign of authoritarianism in America today.

A slow heartbeat drum sets the pace. No chanting. No shouting. No confrontation.

The second lap, representing ICE OUT FOR GOOD, will emulate the first lap’s style and demeanor.

All signs are provided at the start of the march.

This is a peaceful, disciplined visibility action designed to make people pause, reflect, and see what is happening in our country.

<h3>ICE OUT Protest</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, January 31, 2026 at 6:00 PM UTC - 7:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>1153 Main St<br>Saint Johnsbury, VT 05819</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible St. Johnsbury</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>## 🔴 ICE OUT OF OUR COMMUNITIES 🔴

**Join Indivisible St. Johnsbury for a peaceful protest**

📅 **Saturday, January 31, 1–2 pm**

📍 **Main Street, St. Johnsbury**  
  (outside courthouse and post office)

---

## ✊ WHAT TO BRING
A protest sign expressing your solidarity

---

## 💔 WHY WE&apos;RE GATHERING
We are gathering in grief and anger over ICE violence across the country. These killings were not accidents. They are the result of an agency that operates with secrecy, impunity, and force in our communities.

What is happening in Minneapolis is not isolated. ICE raids and armed enforcement are escalating nationwide, putting people in danger, tearing families apart, and spreading fear.

We refuse to normalize this violence. We refuse to look away while federal agents kill people in our cities and hide behind bureaucracy and silence.

---

## 📢 WE DEMAND

- Hold the ICE agents responsible for killing civilians accountable  

- Launch independent investigations into ICE for all the rights they have violated in the name of immigration enforcement  

- No additional federal funding for ICE in Congress  

- ICE out of Minnesota and out of all of our communities **NOW**

We will stand together in a steadfast, nonviolent, and lawful way.  We gather to honor those we have lost.  We gather to protect those who are afraid.  We gather to say clearly that our communities should be safe for everyone.

**🗣️ ICE OUT of our communities for good.**

---

## ❄️ SAFETY TIPS FOR SATURDAY

- 🧥 Dress warmly in layers (temps forecast around 15°F)

- 👢 Wear insulated, waterproof boots with good traction

- 🔥 Bring hand warmers and hot drinks in a thermos

- ⚠️ Watch for ice patches. Take your time and walk carefully

- 🪑 Consider bringing a folding chair or stool if you need to rest

---

## ⚠️ VOLUNTEER NEEDS

<h3>ICE Out for Good</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, January 31, 2026 at 5:00 PM UTC - 7:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>134 Main St<br>Littleton, NH 03561</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> The NH Democratic Party</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>On January 24th ICE agents murdered another citizen. 

His name was Alex Pretti. He was a 37-year-old ICU nurse that worked at the Minneapolis VA Hospital. 

This is the third time this month that our criminal Administration has executed an American citizen.  

It’s time to show the Administration that The People have had enough of this lawlessness. 

On Saturday, Jan. 31st Northern Grafton County Democrats will be out in front of the Post Office and Social Security Office in Littleton from 12-2pm. I invite anyone that still believes in freedom, liberty, due process, and our Constitution to come and join me. 

We want the killings and kidnappings to stop, and we want ICE OUT of New Hampshire!</p>

We also want to emphasize that Alex Pretti was murdered in part for exercising his 2nd Amendment right to carry a firearm. This is a hot button issue for a lot of Georgians, and we want to make sure that they understand that is what was used for justification to shoot him. He did not brandish his weapon, he did not even unholster his weapon, and it had been removed from his person before he was shot. Please join us!</p>

<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Trump has tried to strong-arm Minnesota--and many other states--into handing over their voter rolls, and in Georgia this week, Trump sent the FBI into Fulton County and seized ballots and election records from 2020, pulling evidence from a free and fair election to keep alive the lie that the election was stolen from him.

With ICE now terrorizing Maine, who knows what tricks the Trump regime will pull to subvert our election. While we successfully fended off a MAGA-driven effort to take away absentee voting in Maine last November, there are no guarantees that our voting rights and protections will be there when we go to the polls next November. 

Our democracy only works when every voter can participate freely—and every ballot is protected. Learn about Maine’s election process and constitutionally guaranteed voting rights, including ranked-choice voting and absentee voting. We will also dig into how misinformation and legal challenges can undermine local elections—and what we can do, as citizens, to defend free, fair, and secure elections going forward. The evening will address these two questions:

How do we ensure free, fair and secure elections in Maine’s 2026 midterm elections? 
What action or activities can we all take to ensure Maine&apos;s elections are free, fair and secure?

<h3>No ICE No War</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Friday, May 1, 2026 at 4:00 PM UTC - 6:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Presque Isle County District Court<br>151 E Huron Ave<br>Rogers City, MI 49779</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> May Day Strong</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Trump is waging war and committing murder to enrich his billionaire backers. We are fighting to stop him. **Stand with us and take action this weekend to demand an end to the occupation of Venezuela and our cities.** 

We’re focusing on corporate targets - companies set to benefit most from the occupation of ICE or Venezuela. 

This week, our target is **Hilton Hotels**, housing this administration&apos;s ICE goons.

**We stand united demanding an end to the Venezuelan occupation and the removal of reckless untrained ICE agents from our communities.** And we&apos;re taking our fight to the companies that are backing this administration and benefiting most.

**Together we will hit these companies in their pocketbooks, force the administration to end the occupation of Venezuela and our cities and spread the word to our neighbors that we deserve better.**

Every dollar spent in wars overseas or at home is a dollar we paid for with our taxes - a dollar that could and should go to helping our communities thrive. We can have good jobs, better schools, access to healthcare and get our basic needs met. But not while our government works for billionaires and not for us.

Join us, stand strong and speak up.

*Please note: A core principle behind all our events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events*</p>

<h3>Northern Michigan People’s Hearing: Ice Storm Impacts, One Year On</h3>

<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Treetops Resort<br>3962 Wilkinson Rd<br>Gaylord, MI 49735</p>

<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Join us in Gaylord for a People’s Hearing bringing together community members, local leaders, and environmental experts from across Northern Michigan.

One year after the devastating March 2025 ice storms, families, farmers, and small business owners are still navigating a long road to recovery—from repairing property and rebuilding livelihoods to preparing for future extreme weather storms. 

This People’s Hearing creates space for Northern Michigan residents to share what they lived through and speak directly with elected officials about what their communities need moving forward.

The event is designed as a community gathering, with time to connect with neighbors, Michigan-based nonprofit organizations, and local leaders. Food and drinks will be available. Members of the press will be in attendance to help elevate community voices and stories beyond the room.</p>

<h3>Say Something! Do Something!</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 21, 2026 at 7:00 PM UTC - 9:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>International Servant Leaders Museum<br>9233 Shermer Rd<br>Morton Grove, IL 60053</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Niles Maine Township</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>On the birthday of John Lewis, we gather in the spirit of good trouble—the disciplined, nonviolent pursuit of justice rooted in conscience, service, and respect for the rule of law. Hosted by the International Servant Leaders Museum in association with  Indivisible Niles Maine Township,  this educational program reflects the core principles of servant leadership and a clear commitment to legal rights, constitutional protections, and lawful civic engagement.

The Reverend Dr. Michael Woolf will reflect on his civil rights protest experiences at the Broadview ICE facility, offering firsthand insight into faith-guided, nonviolent action that seeks accountability while honoring due process. This presentation will be followed by an informative presentation by Sanctuary Niles Township about how to protect our communities through local advocacy efforts, mutual aid and worker solidarity. The event will end with an opportunity for informal chats with the speakers, and representatives of several local Indivisible chapters.

Together, this program honors the legacy of John Lewis by translating moral courage into informed action—cultivating servant leaders who uphold human dignity, strengthen community trust, and work within the law to advance justice for all.</p>

<h3>[Your City Citgo/Chevron] No Occupation of Venezuela, No Occupation of Our Cities</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Friday, May 1, 2026 at 9:00 PM UTC - 1:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Blackshear<br>Gordon St/ Highway 84<br>Blackshear, GA 31516</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> May Day Strong</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Don’t stand on the sidelines while Trump spills blood on behalf of the billionaire class while they jack up the prices for rent, healthcare and groceries . **Stand with us and take action.** 

We know the bombs over Venezuela and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem’s untrained ICE militia in our cities are about billionaires making themselves richer no matter the human cost. **We stand united demanding an end to the Venezuelan occupation and the removal of reckless untrained ICE agents from our communities. **

Every dollar spent in wars overseas or at home is a dollar we paid for with our taxes - a dollar that could and should go to helping our communities thrive. **We can have good jobs, better schools, access to healthcare and get our basic needs met. But not while our government works for billionaires and not for us.**

Join us, stand strong and speak up. 

*Please note: A core principle behind all our events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events*</p>

<h3>Whistle Kit/Senate Debate Watch Party - Elk Grove Village, Illinois</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Friday, February 20, 2026 at 12:30 AM UTC - 2:30 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Real Time Sports Bar &amp; Grill<br>1120 W Devon Ave<br>Elk Grove Village, IL 60007</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Elk Grove Township</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>**Join Indivisible Elk Grove Township in blowing the whistle on ICE!**

Whistle Kit making parties are a community safety practice rooted in resistance movements to help alert neighbors during immigration raids.

In moments like these, we’re reminded that protection is not just a policy, it’s a community responsibility.

Make new friends, watch the U.S. Senate debate, and discuss local and national issues, all while saving democracy by making Whistle Kits **TOGETHER**!

We will provide all you&apos;ll need, including zines, Know Your Rights cards, and whistle kit supplies! We ask that you take kits home with you to distribute to local business, neighbors, and anyone who is in this fight with us. Bring yourself, and perhaps a few friends! 

Real Time Sports Bar &amp; Grill is graciously allowing us to use their location, so  we ask that you please purchase food and beverages while you&apos;re here. Everyone will receive their own individual tab. Please tip your server!</p>

<h3>Signs of Solidarity Outreach #2 at Gurnee Mills</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 7, 2026 at 5:00 PM UTC - 7:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Gurnee Mills Mall - Rainforest Cafe Entrance<br>5688 Northridge Dr<br>Gurnee, IL 60031</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> NE Lake County IL Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>**Join NE Lake County Indivisible Outreach Team for our 2nd Signs of Solidarity Outreach at Gurnee Mills!**

Signs of Solidarity (SoS) is a national campaign encouraging businesses, construction sites and restaurants to post signs declaring that ICE is not welcome on the premises, and is prohibited from entering spaces designated as private or employees only. We will provide materials and training so you can have conversations with local managers and business owners about displaying signs, protecting immigrant workers, and their rights and responsibilities if ICE shows up at their workplace.

Through the winter months, we will plan outreach efforts indoors where possible - doing Know Your Rights canvassing apartment complexes, mall walking with SoS, and the occasional neighborhood walk on those balmy Midwestern 40 degree days when we can get them!

We will provide all training and supplies, and folks can stay as long as they are comfortable and able to stay buddied up. We ensure that canvassing is done in pairs for safety reasons.

Remember to dress for the weather, and wear your walking shoes!

This event is planned by the Outreach Team of NE Lake County Indivisible.

<h3>ICE OUT: Who will protect the Children?</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Friday, January 30, 2026 at 7:00 PM UTC - 8:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Civic Center Park<br>900 57th St<br>Kenosha, WI 53140</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>ICE OUT: Community Protest Against 287(g)
Hosted by CUSH (Congregations United to Serve Humanity), being shared by Kenosha Indivisible Chapter and Hands Off Kenosha

📅 January 30
🕐 1:00-2:00
📍 Civic Center Park
900 57th St, Kenosha, WI 53140

Join CUSH and community members for a peaceful protest demanding an end to the harms caused by ICE in our region. We are calling on Sheriff Zoerner to rescind the 287(g) agreement, which entangles local law enforcement with federal immigration enforcement and puts immigrant families and communities at risk.

The 287(g) program has led to fear, racial profiling, and the erosion of trust between residents and those sworn to protect them. Kenosha deserves policies that prioritize community safety, dignity, and human rights—not collaboration with an agency that tears families apart.

This protest is about accountability, transparency, and protecting our neighbors. All are welcome who believe our local government should serve the people—not ICE.

✊ ICE out of Kenosha. End 287(g). Protect our community.

Call-A-Thon to defund Ice to follow.

<h3>Knit a Resist Hat. Write Resist Postcards.</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 7, 2026 at 6:00 PM UTC - 9:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Leland Township Library<br>203 Cedar St<br>Leland, MI 49654</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Leelanau Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Want to feel like you are making a difference?  Join us and work on knitting or crocheting a Resist hat and/or write postcards. And if you already have a project in mind that you want to work on, feel free to bring that instead.  We are flexible!

I will have postcards and 200 stamps to send out to Congress and the White House.  Thanks to Leelanau Indivisible for purchasing the stamps.

We will also make Resist hats using fingering, DK, or worsted weight yarn.  They are based on the 1940’s hat Norwegians made and wore as a form of visual protest against Nazi occupation of their country. Within two years, the Nazis made these protest hats illegal and punishable by law to wear, make, or distribute.   The hats are red and have a tassel.

Patterns we are using:

Feel free to see what I am knitting.  https://www.ravelry.com/projects/kmd52/melt-the-ice-hat

And, because it makes it more fun, I encourage all of us to bring snacks to share!

<h3>ICE OUT FOR GOOD AND PRETTI! Burlington</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, January 31, 2026 at 5:00 PM UTC - 6:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Parking lot across the street from Veterans Terrace<br>589 Milwaukee Ave<br>Burlington, WI 53105</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> WisDems</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>On Saturday, January 31, at 11:00 am, we will meet in the parking lot across the street from Veterans Terrace, 589 Milwaukee Avenue, Burlington, WI. Our event will run from 11:00 am to noon.

Please bring your signs, cameras, and whistles if you have them. Come to meet and support one another. As you walk around, please take the opportunity to introduce yourself to others and make some new friends. Let’s show our solidarity to keep ICE out of our cities and towns. I know the warmth you show each other will help keep all of us safe and hopefully melt the ice!

A core principle of all our rally events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values and to act lawfully at these events. Weapons of any kind, including those that are legally permitted, should not be brought. We must protect everyone’s safety. If someone yells profanity or insults at you, please ignore them and walk away. Do not respond or engage. Do not yell or swear back. Please find me (Jan) if you have any issues.

Please park on the surrounding streets in Burlington or in a nearby parking structure. If you are less able to walk, you may park in the rally parking lot. The weather on Saturday looks okay but rather cold, at about 18 ºF.

If you have not made a sign yet, the Burlington Democrats office will be open on Saturday morning from 10:00 to 11:00 am. They will have sign-making materials available. The office is located at the very west end of Low Daily, 700 N. Pine Street (about three blocks away).

When you arrive, please stop at the registration table to check in. I look forward to seeing you again and thanking you in person.

See you Saturday!

<h3>Ice Out For Good - Brookfield WI</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, January 31, 2026 at 4:30 PM UTC - 6:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Thomas Lane &amp; West Bluemound Road<br>Brookfield, WI 53005</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Brookfield Resist</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>We’ve seen video after video of Kristi Noem’s terror squads in Minneapolis, the flagrant racial profiling of innocent people on the street—demanding that American citizens, including police officers and Native Americans, show their papers, and even detaining some. We&apos;ve seen the murder of Renee Good, the gassing and clubbing of people for exercising their First Amendment rights, and now the gangland style killing of Alex Jeffrey Pretti—a 37-year-old ICU nurse trying to help a woman knocked to the ground.

And all that Kristi Noem can do is spew lie after lie about what really happened despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary. The Fascists in charge are slowly tightening their grip on our freedoms and democracy. When Fascism takes over – you will have no rights.

Stand with us this weekend to reject Trump, his administration, and the spineless Republicans in Congress for allowing this to go on.</p>

<h3>1/31/26 Pop Up Protest at the City Hall / Lightner Museum Downtown - Stand for Human Rights</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, January 31, 2026 at 8:00 PM UTC - 9:30 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>75 King St<br>St. Augustine, FL 32084</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible St. Johns County</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Join us for a peaceful, nonviolent pop-up visibility action in St. Augustine to stand against ICE abuses and authoritarianism, and in support of human rights and the rule of law.

When: Saturday, Jan 31 • 3:00–4:30 PM
Where: City Hall (meet at City Hall — look for the group with signs)

Plan &amp; Safety Guidelines (please read):

Peaceful + nonviolent event. We’re here to be visible and be heard—no intimidation, no confrontation. If there are agitators, ignore them. 

Do not block sidewalks, driveways, or traffic. Keep pathways clear and stay aware of pedestrians/bikes.

If the group grows larger than ~25, we’ll split into smaller groups nearby to stay safe and avoid crowding.

Follow basic de-escalation: don’t engage with hecklers; don’t argue—wave, smile, and refocus. The peace sign is always a good counter to a rude gesture. 

If you feel unsafe at any time, step away and notify an organizer.

Bring:
Signs (keep them readable)
Water
Sunblock / hat
Comfortable shoes
A friend or two

Why it matters:
Strength in numbers—and visibility matters. Come stand with neighbors who believe in dignity, democracy, and accountability.

RSVP requested but not required.</p>

<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Main St Bridge<br>E Main St<br>Dover-Foxcroft, ME 04426</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Wednesday, January 7th, an American citizen was killed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

A broad coalition of groups across the country is calling for a coordinated Ice Out For Good Weekend of Action on Saturday, January 10th and Sunday, January 11th to demand accountability, honor the life lost, and make visible the human cost of ICE’s actions. 

A core principle behind all ICE Out For Good events is a commitment to nonviolent action and no civil disobedience. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values, and to act lawfully at these events. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events. All events should be held in public spaces or on public property.

<h3>KNIT-IN &amp; CROCHET ICE AWAY</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Thursday, February 5, 2026 at 12:30 AM UTC - 2:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Democratic party of Outagamie County<br>516 W College Ave<br>Appleton, WI 54911</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> WisDems</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Join fellow crafters to knit your own MELT THE ICE HAT, or knit one for someone else.
You will need to purchase the pattern in advance. One site is Ravelry. Cost is $5. We cannot make copies of the pattern for distribution per copyright laws.
Check the pattern for materials to bring with you: red yarn, needles, markers, and a bit of chocolate. Ok, that’s not in the pattern, but it’s a good idea!
The history behind this pattern is: In the 1940s, Norwegians made and wore RED pointed hats with a tassel as a form of visual protest against the Nazi occupation of their country. Within two years, the Nazis made these protest hats illegal and punishable by law to wear, make, or distribute. It is time to revisit this design.
Hope you can join us. KNIT ON!!!</p>

<h3>No War, No ICE, No Kings Protest on Madison&apos;s East Side</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Sunday, February 1, 2026 at 4:00 PM UTC - 6:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>4346 Commercial Ave<br>Madison, WI 53714</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> WisDems</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Meet us on Madison&apos;s East Side to Protest the Trump Administration.

This administration has deployed their secret police to our streets to abduct our neighbors and drive fear into the populace. We will not stand for ICE terrorizing our communities and murdering protesters. We demand an end to the terror and justice for all harmed. 

Trump&apos;s assault on Venezuela is an extreme abuse of power that cannot be tolerated. His actions could destabilize South America and cause widespread immiseration in the Western Hemisphere. How dare he do this in our name! We say, No! NO ICE! No war for oil! No to colonialism! We demand Peace among nations, peace in our communities, and the restoration of sanity.

Meet us on the pedestrian bridge over Hwy 30 that connects Commercial Avenue to North Thompson Drive. This is a non-violent protest. Bring your big signs and flags.</p>

<h3>Hands Off St Peters Weekly Protest</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, January 31, 2026 at 6:00 PM UTC - 7:30 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>MidRivers Drive and SueMandy Drive Intersection<br>200 Mid Rivers Mall Dr<br>St. Peters, MO 63376</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>The January 31st event is still going on, although one of the partnering organizations has cancelled their participation due to the frigid weather and snow and ice covered sidewalks. Indivisible We Will Persist has cancelled this weekend only but Democracy Squad, the other partner, has been out clearing sidewalks and will be out on Saturday as usual. Please prepare for the bitter cold and use extra caution, as most sidewalks are still covered in snow and ice.

Join us for a peaceful, nonviolent demonstration with opportunities to connect with local organizations committed to justice and equity.

Please note that St Peters has an ordinance that limits sign dimensions to 24&quot;x24&quot;. The organizers appreciate the professionalism of the St Peters Police Department week after week. Please help maintain our good relationship with them by complying with this ordinance.

Also, please be sensitive to the needs of businesses in the area. There is a ton of parking available within a short walk. Please do not park in the Veterinary Emergency Group or in the Bank of America parking lot.

We do a monthly food drive on the 3rd Saturday of the month

This a local Indivisible event!

*A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*</p>

<h3>DeLand - ICE Murders Again Protest - January 31, 2026 - 10am-12pm</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, January 31, 2026 at 3:00 PM UTC - 5:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Corners of North Woodland Blvd &amp; International Speedway Blvd<br>1490 N Woodland Blvd<br>DeLand, FL 32720</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> 50501 Volusia</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Enough is enough. Once again, lives have been lost because of ICE and the violent system protecting it. People are dying in ICE custody through cruelty, medical neglect, and abuse. U.S. citizens peacefully protesting these injustices are also being met with state violence—injured, brutalized, and killed for exercising their constitutional rights.

This is not “law and order.” This is impunity.

We refuse to be silent while human beings are caged, while protesters are treated as enemies, and while deaths are dismissed as collateral damage. Immigration enforcement should never carry a death sentence—and neither should peaceful protest.

This protest is a public stand against:

   - Deaths and abuse of people in ICE custody
   - Violence against U.S. citizens peacefully protesting
   - A system that dehumanizes immigrants and criminalizes dissent
   - The total lack of accountability for state violence

ICE Murders Again. In detention centers. In the streets. And we are done looking away.

Bring signs. Bring your voice. Bring your anger and your compassion.

This will be a peaceful, loud, and unapologetic protest.</p>

<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>All 4 corners of Donnelly and 441, Mount Dora, FL 32757<br>North Donnelly Street &amp; U.S. 441<br>Mount Dora, FL 32757</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>***ICE Out! No Kings***
***This is NOT a national No Kings event!***
***Where and When?***
On the corners of 441 and Donnelly in Mount Dora, Florida 32757
Sunday, February 1, 2026  - 2:00pm-3:30pm

***How?***
Bring an ant-ICE sign to wave. You can also bring an instrument if you want to play, music and maybe wear a costume if you feel like it. 
Parking by Wendy&apos;s and the CF Fitness plaza or McDonald&apos;s side where Key Food shopping center.

***Why?***
The death of Alex Pretti was the final straw of the abominable actions of the DHS under Kristi Noem! We are demanding that the US Senate totally defund ICE and for Congress to institute impeachment proceedings against Kristi Noem! What is happening is un-American acts perpetrated against the people in our country and against our Constitutional Rights.

<h3>Fight ICE with the Keep Families Together Bill Package</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, January 31, 2026 at 6:00 PM UTC - 7:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Marathon County Democratic Party Office<br>218 Sherman St<br>Wausau, WI 54401</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Join us for a critical public presentation on the Keep Families Together bill package—legislation urgently needed to protect Wisconsin families and communities from unconstitutional and inhumane ICE actions.
This presentation will explain how the bills work, why they are needed now, and what is at stake if Wisconsin fails to act. Families are being harmed, trust in our communities is being eroded, and the window for meaningful state-level protection is closing.
Attendees will learn how these bills can limit harmful ICE practices and will engage in a focused discussion on how to build the public pressure and political momentum necessary to pass legislation that defends our families, our communities, and our shared values.

<h3>Abolish ICE Rally</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Sunday, February 1, 2026 at 8:00 PM UTC - 10:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>U.S. 1 &amp; Florida 520<br>Cocoa, FL 32922</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> BrevardDems</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Please join us this Sunday, February 1st at 3:00 PM at the corners of 520 and US-1 to peacefully stand against the brutality being carried out by the Trump administration, CBP, and ICE.

We are gathering in response to the murders of Renee Nicole Good, Keith Porter Jr., and Alex Pretti. Renee should still be alive. Alex — an ICU nurse, a caregiver, a man who stepped in to protect others — should still be here. Keith Porter Jr. was killed on New Year’s Eve by an off-duty ICE officer. These were not tragic accidents. They were the predictable result of state violence and a system that refuses accountability.

This rally is about drawing a line. About rejecting the normalization of cruelty. About saying we will not accept a government that treats human lives as expendable and then shrugs when people are killed.
This action is sponsored by Awake Brevard and SCDSA. Show up. Bring your voice. Bring your anger and your grief. Stand with us for Renee. For Alex. For Keith. For everyone who could be next.

Sunday, February 1 • 3:00 PM
Corners of 520 &amp; US-1
Silence is not an option anymore.</p>

<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Please join us this Sunday, February 1st at 3:00 PM at the corners of 520 and US-1 to stand against the brutality being carried out by the Trump administration, CBP, and ICE.
We are gathering in response to the murders of Renee Nicole Good and Alex Pretti. Renee should still be alive. Alex — an ICU nurse, a caregiver, a man who stepped in to protect others — should still be here. These were not tragic accidents. They were the predictable result of state violence and a system that refuses accountability.
This rally is about drawing a line. About rejecting the normalization of cruelty. About saying we will not accept a government that treats human lives as expendable and then shrugs when people are killed.
This action is sponsored by Awake Brevard and SCDSA. Show up. Bring your voice. Bring your anger and your grief. Stand with us for Renee. For Alex. For everyone who could be next.
Sunday, February 1 • 3:00 PM
Corners of 520 &amp; US-1
Silence is not an option anymore.

*A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*</p>

<h3>Pretti Good Time To Melt Ice</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, January 31, 2026 at 3:00 PM UTC - 5:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Posner Park Shopping Plaza<br>1300 Posner Blvd<br>Davenport, FL 33837</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Where &amp; When?

Date: 1/31/25
Time: 10am-12pm
Address: Posner Village &amp; Hwy 27
1300 Posner Blvd
Davenport, Fl. 33897


Why are we gathering?

We will be holding a sign waving rally to tell our local Law Enforcement, as well as our Sheriff&apos;s &amp; Hwy LEO&apos;s  that we will no longer tolerate people being un-alived anywhere in this country for simply helping their neighbors stay safe.

WE ARE ALSO COLLECTING FOOD FOR THOSE WHO CANNOT GET OUT TO GO SHOPPING. 

I know that in our neighborhood, we have people who haven&apos;t left their houses for weeks due to fear they won&apos;t come home.  Please bring any amount of food that you would like.  I will be bringing a cooler for those who can bring perishable (produce--meat--milk--butter ect.)  Dried foods are a blessing, but you can&apos;t make mac &amp; cheese without milk and butter.  So we will be trying to supply those items as well. 

Please sign up below for any questions you may have &amp; for the information of this rally.

If you have a Tambourine or any type of instrument, please feel free to bring it. Wear a costume - any kind of costume - they are attention-getters!

What Not To Do?

If approached by counter-protesters, do NOT engage. Just ignore them. They are sometimes very difficult to ignore, but their sole reason for being is to &quot;own us&quot;.

You may be tempted to talk with them if they put a microphone in your face, but resist that temptation! What to do? Ignore any that call you names, that give you the finger, that oppose you in any way. If we ignore them, they will get tired of doing it. They NEED your reaction. Don&apos;t give it to them!

As this is in conjunction with Indivisible, we agree with the following statement which will apply to this rally. 

*A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*

We can&apos;t wait to see you there!!  Come show up for Davenport, Haines City, Dundee, Auburndale,  wherever you are from, we look forward to you attending.  See you there.</p>

<h3>ABOLISH ICE Protest</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, January 31, 2026 at 6:00 PM UTC - 8:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Old Kmart building across from JavaVino<br>2415 State Rd<br>La Crosse, WI 54601</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> La Crosse Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>When: January 31st 12pm to 2pm

Where: cross section of State Road and Losey Blvd, La Crosse, Wi (in front of the old Kmart building)

Thousands have been abducted and many deported without the due process they are promised by the Constitution. Hundreds have died in ICE custody and, now, two people have lost their lives on Minnesota streets in ICE actions. The continuous escalation of violence and disregard by the government to reign in their actors has shown that ICE cannot be reformed, it must be ABOLISHED. 

This Saturday we will take to the street and demand the removal of ICE from our cities and our country. 

On site we will be providing whistles to as many of you as we can. These whistles are intended to allow us to communicate about ICE without needing technology. We will have instructions for the whistles on site and will be following the MN protocol for the use. 

**Note that not every community will benefit from the whistles, and so is is important to consider the area in which you live, as the whistles seem to be more popular for urban than rural areas and that you should also consider your own role the continued resistance against facism. For example, if you intend on not becoming a Civilian Observer or Verifier, you may be less inclined to need a whistle at this time. Consider these examples and choose what feels right for you in the moment. 

We want to encourage everyone to use our normal Indivisible protocol as far as safety goes, but emphasize winter wear. Bring hand warmers for your neighbors, we will have some on hand as well.

We would also like to emphasize mutual aid at this event and would like to encourage everyone that is able, to bring a pair of men&apos;s warm winter gloves to donate to WINN or to donate to the WINN to help our unsheltered neighbors. The La Crosse County Dems building will be open and have coffee/hot chocolate available and will be open if people need signs/buttons/bathroom breaks or just to warm up for a few minutes.

The donation link for WINN can be found here: https://www.whatineednow.org/donate

We will pull through these times by caring for one another. Just as Alex Pretti did and many others are still doing. Let&apos;s show Alex that La Crosse cares.

In additon to abolishing ICE, it would be wonderful to see neighbors helping neighbors, singing, chanting, and rejoicing at the top of our lungs, loud enough for MN to hear that we love and support them.</p>

<h3>Stop 287g, Abolish ICE! Lakeland, FL</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 28, 2026 at 10:00 PM UTC - 12:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Lakeside Village Mall<br>1479 Town Center Dr<br>Lakeland, FL 33803</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p># 🛑 Stop 287g ⛓️‍💥 Abolish ICE 🧊 Save the Everglades 🐊
*Hosted by DEFUND OLIGARCHY · BLESSED BY LIBERTY · INDIVISIBLE*
([en español](https://mobilize.us/s/skrhfa))

#### Non-Partisan Public Demonstration — Saturday, Jan 24, 2026
##### Lakeland, FL

For 01/24, we are meeting at 4:00 pm at the intersection, but we will be more on the side in front of Starbucks and Louis Papa&apos;s, but outside the mall, not inside the mall. Locally this is a small assembly, but we are in solidarity with many other groups throughout the nation demonstrating against Avelo, 287g agreements, and human rights abuses in small cities just like ours.

##### Read all instructions

We are taking a stand for ICE abolition and against the removal of individuals without due process — violating the core principles of our republic. 

This is a call to action. We’re joining forces to demand that Polk County end its involvement in unconstitutional detention policies.

# 🪧 Our Demands
✊ Polk County Government, it’s ICE or us.

You cannot serve both the people and an agency that tears families apart, starves humans, withholds water, denies medical care, kills people, forces humans into slavery, performs sterilizations without consent, and refuses to recognize U.S. birth certificates and REAL ID.

✊ Polk County residents: Boycott anyone profiting from ICE

✊ Polk County: End 287g agreement.

✊ DHS &amp; James Uthmeier: No Alligator Alley Concentration Camp. No cages on sacred ground. 🐊

✊ ICE: Stay out of Florida. Stop terrorizing schools, hospitals, courthouses, and workplaces. End detention. Process only violent offenders with criminal convictions.

✊ LPD &amp; PCSO: Do not cooperate with ICE. Arrest ICE agents operating without signed judicial warrants for violent criminal offenders.

✊ Sheriff Grady Judd: Stop collaborating with ICE until DHS reforms are complete. PSCO should not be helping send people to concentration camps.

✊Scott Franklin, Rick Scott, Ashley Moody: Defund &amp; abolish ICE. 

✊ Florida State Legislature: Ban the use of state taxpayer money for ICE operations. Pass legislation banning cooperation with ICE beyond what federal law requires.


# 🛑 WHY WE’RE PROTESTING

❌U.S. citizens and work permit holders — like Juan Carlos Lopez-Gomez and Heidy Sanchez Tejeda — have been detained without cause.

❌DHS &amp; ICE have unilaterally seized protected land in the Everglades to create a 5,000-person prison with no A/C and no access to lawyers by raiding FEMA and charging the state $450 million, despite the objections of county and tribal leadership. 

❌Children are being separated from parents, denied legal representation, and even deported during active custody disputes — like two-year-old citizen known as V.M.L.

❌Our Constitutional rights — due process, legal counsel, protection from executive overreach — are being ignored.

# ✨ WE STAND FOR:
- Families
- Immigration rights
- Due process
- Constitutional liberty for all
- Holding corporations accountable for profiting from human suffering

# 🗓️ EVENT DETAILS

📍 Lakeland, FL 

🕒 Saturday, Jan 24, 2025, 4 pm - 6 pm

🎨 Signs provided (but feel free to bring your own especially if it highlights the case of individuals who have been unlawfully detained or removed)

🌞 Dress for the weather &amp; wear sunscreen, sunglasses, and a mask for privacy

# 💡 TIPS

👍We are committed to nonviolence and having a peaceful assembly. Stay respectful in all interactions.

👍Be alert: impersonators and fake news outlets posing as independent media may be present. Verify credentials before giving an interview.

👍Don’t engage with trolls or agitators. They may pretend to be a fellow protester. If they are really interested, you can point them towards the pamphlets and literature that we have. Remember we are fighting for everyone&apos;s rights, even the people that don&apos;t agree with us and the ones that are really annoying.

👍Focus your energy on building unity and protecting our democratic, constitutional republic.

# 🎶 SING FOR LIBERTY 
### We recommend brushing up on these songs if you like to sing along, but we alternate a lot with regular chanting and mini speeches, so no pressure to sing.

<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>14450 49th Street N<br>Clearwater, FL 33762</p>

<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>In cooperation with The Interfaith Alliance, we are hosting a weekly vigil/demonstration on 49th street by the Pinellas Courthouse Complex.

At least 30 people died in ICE “Detention” in 2025. Currently more than 59,000 immigrants are being held by ICE, separated from friends, family, and enduring inhumane conditions. Our government via ICE is perpetrating human right violations. We will not stand by while watching it happen. Please join us for this weekly action, in solidarity with the mothers, fathers, sons and daughters being held by ICE. We will not stop til the detention centers are closed and our immigrant friends are given due process and released.

<h3>NO KINGS 3</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, March 28, 2026 at 2:00 PM UTC - 4:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Seminole Boulevard &amp; West Bay Drive<br>Largo, FL 33771</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Mid-Pinellas</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>In 2025, millions of Americans came together in nonviolent protest to oppose the growing authoritarian actions of the Trump administration and affirm that this nation belongs to its people, not to kings. Since then, people have continued to rise up nonviolently against the Trump administration’s ongoing brutality and abuses of power, including the latest escalation in Minnesota. 

The No Kings Coalition is activating an immediate and ongoing nationwide digital organizing effort leading up to our next mass mobilization on March 28, including a flagship event in the Twin Cities.

But we want to say upfront: As we prepare for a massive mobilization months from now, we cannot lose sight of the work right in front of us -- in Congress, in our statehouses, and in our neighborhoods -- to rein in ICE and protect each other from this regime’s chaos, corruption, and violence. 

👉 That’s why the No Kings coalition will be leading regular ICE watch trainings throughout the winter. 

👉 That’s why we must continue to put pressure on Democrats to hold the line on reining in ICE and denying it a single additional penny in taxpayer funding.

👉 And that’s why we’ll likely be asking you to exercise your First Amendment rights through a number of mobilizations before the big one.</p>

<h3>Open Letter to Sarasota County School Board</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Thursday, January 15, 2026 at 5:00 AM UTC - 5:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> SEE Alliance</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>**Sign the community’s open letter to the Sarasota County School Board: keep ICE out of Sarasota County Schools.**

This letter will be delivered publicly at the Tuesday, January 20 school board meeting as part of the official public record. Signing allows us to demonstrate clear community concern.

Signers of this letter will be invited to a community forum to receive clarity on what is and isn’t happening in Sarasota County Schools, including the limits of this resolution. Signers will also receive a shared messaging guide to support calm, factual, student-centered dialogue in emails, comments, and conversations.


**READ THE OPEN LETTER BELOW**

Dear Sarasota County School Board Members,

We, a coalition of students, parents, educators, community leaders, and concerned residents across Sarasota County and Florida, write with urgency and deep concern regarding the recent resolution introduced by the Board Chair  affirming “full cooperation” with law enforcement, including U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). 

This resolution, while not altering formal district policy, imports national fears into our local schools. It confounds civil immigration matters with criminal activity and creates the perception that schools are extensions of enforcement rather than spaces for learning. This undermines the trust essential for student success and has already begun to sow unnecessary fear among families at a time when immigrant communities nationwide are facing escalating threats.

In the wake of national discussions around mass deportations, expanded surveillance, and normalized dehumanizing anti-immigrant rhetoric, school leaders have a responsibility to protect stability for all students. Sarasota schools have long been pillars of trust and education in our community. This resolution does not address a local crisis; ICE is not currently operating on Sarasota school campuses, there is no routine enforcement, and our schools already comply with valid warrants and legal requirements. This resolution does not change policy or practice. Its impact is cultural, contributing to  fear and confusion that harms all students and families.

The concerns raised by this resolution are well supported. Research, lived experiences, and expert insights from educators and mental health professionals show that such enforcement-oriented language in school contexts causes real damage:

- Fear alone increases absenteeism and chronic absenteeism, as families disengage from schools to avoid perceived risk. This has occurred in school districts across Florida.
- Fear reduces academic performance and classroom engagement, with students experiencing heightened anxiety, stress, and mental health strain.
- Fear erodes trust between families and educators, discouraging communication with teachers, counselors, and nurses, which is essential to student well-being.
- Immigration violations are largely civil matters, not criminal offenses. Language in this resolution that conflates the two creates confusion about existing district policies and undermines public understanding of how schools actually operate..
- In a national context of heightened enforcement and surveillance, vague language creates confusion by conflicting with established procedures, which Sarasota schools will continue to follow. 

This resolution distracts from real educational needs in Sarasota schools, prioritizing political posturing over student-centered leadership.

Schools work when families trust them. Resolutions do not need to change policy to cause harm. The fear they generate alone is enough to keep students out of classrooms and undermine learning. Our schools should be places of stability in national moments of uncertainty, not sources of fear.

Board members, we urge you to use your authority to reject this resolution and prevent it from advancing. Doing so would reaffirm a commitment to keeping Sarasota schools focused on education, safety, and success for all students. Specifically, we ask the Board to:

1. Publicly affirm that Sarasota County Schools and grounds will continue to operate under existing district policy and established procedures, including compliance with the law as required, and that schools are not, and will not be used for, routine immigration enforcement activity.
2. Vote against, or withdraw, the resolution affirming “full cooperation” with ICE, which does not change policy but risks mischaracterizing the role of schools and creating unnecessary fear within Sarasota County Schools. 
3. Recommit to student privacy, safety, and equitable access to education for all students, regardless of immigration status.
4. Engage the community through a public forum where families, students, and educators can ask questions, receive clear information about district policy and practice, and discuss school operations without fear.

This letter will be delivered publicly at the Tuesday, January 20 school board meeting as part of the official public record. Signers of this letter will be invited to a community forum to learn more about the situation, receive a clear explanation of what is happening and what is not, and access a shared messaging guide to support calm, factual, student-centered engagement.

By taking the steps outlined above, the Board can help restore clarity, trust, and stability in our schools. Our strong schools depend on students showing up, families feeling secure, and educators being able to do their jobs without fear disrupting the classroom. Actions taken by the school board should strengthen this foundation.

We urge our elected school board members to lead with responsibility, and a commitment to keeping schools focused on what they exist to do: educate, support, and protect students.

Signed, 


Students, parents, educators, and community members</p>

<h3>Resist Fascism &amp; Save Our Democracy - 44th Weekly Sarasota Rally</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, February 3, 2026 at 2:00 PM UTC - 4:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>2001 Siesta Dr<br>Sarasota, FL 34239</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Join us for our 44th weekly rally in Sarasota to resist fascism, get ICE off our streets, and support Social Security. Keep the pressure on! Meet friendly, like-minded people who are standing up for our rights. Help save the Social Security we paid for and our families are paying for.

------------------------------------------------
* No Trump “ICE GOONS” in SARASOTA Schools!
* No concentration camps!
* No kidnapping of innocent people!
------------------------------------------------

This is a local, Sarasota-based, grassroots rally by Indivisible Sarasota.

WE ARE SEEN BY 2,500-3,000 VEHICLES EACH WEEK!

We meet outside the Social Security office, at the intersection of Siesta Drive and South Tamiami Trail. (see map)  The big sign there is for the restaurant, Flemings.

The rally is in the shade and during morning rush hour, so it will be relatively cool when the weather is hot, but with a lot of visibility.

Parking is right across Siesta Drive in the empty shopping mall parking lot.
By persisting week after week, we are showing the people of Sarasota that we are in this for the long term and will persevere as long as necessary.
Expect lots of supportive honking of horns.

Bring your own sign about ICE, Social Security or any other topic related to the resistance against the MAGA attack on our democracy.
See you there!</p>

<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>About this event:

Wednesday, January 7th, a fellow Minnesotan was killed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Minneapolis, Minnesota. This killing is part of a broader pattern of unchecked violence, impunity, and abuse carried out by federal immigration enforcement agencies against members of our communities.

A broad coalition of groups across the country is calling for a coordinated Ice Out For Good Weekend of Action on Saturday, January 10th and Sunday, January 11th to demand accountability, honor the life lost, and make visible the human cost of ICE’s actions.

We are all Renee.

We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values, and to act lawfully at these events.

<h3>Joyful Resistance Coral Springs #NoICENoWar</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Friday, May 1, 2026 at 8:30 PM UTC - 10:30 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>University Drive in front of the Northwest Regional Library<br>3151 N University Dr<br>Coral Springs, FL 33065</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> May Day Strong</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Trump is waging war and committing murder to enrich his billionaire backers. We are fighting to stop him. **Stand with us and take action this weekend to demand an end to the occupation of Venezuela and our cities.** 

We’re focusing on corporate targets - companies set to benefit most from the occupation of ICE or Venezuela. 

This week, our target is **Hilton Hotels**, housing this administration&apos;s ICE goons.

**We stand united demanding an end to the Venezuelan occupation and the removal of reckless untrained ICE agents from our communities.** And we&apos;re taking our fight to the companies that are backing this administration and benefiting most.

**Together we will hit these companies in their pocketbooks, force the administration to end the occupation of Venezuela and our cities and spread the word to our neighbors that we deserve better.**

Every dollar spent in wars overseas or at home is a dollar we paid for with our taxes - a dollar that could and should go to helping our communities thrive. We can have good jobs, better schools, access to healthcare and get our basic needs met. But not while our government works for billionaires and not for us.

Join us, stand strong and speak up.

*Please note: A core principle behind all our events is a commitment to nonviolent action.

<h3>F.A.F.O March - Forever Against Fascist Oppression March - Indivisible Wilton Manors</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 21, 2026 at 5:00 PM UTC - 8:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Corner of US1 &amp; E<br>5000 N Federal Hwy<br>Fort Lauderdale, FL 33308</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>This is a local Indivisible Wilton Manors event.

The F.A.F.O March, Forever Against Fascist Oppression March.

Join us as we march from Fort Lauderdale, over the bridge, in to Lauderdale By The Sea (LBTS), to protest there against this administration and their current actions in our country against it&apos;s own people.
We the people RESIST &amp; REJECT all forms of authoritarian and fascist regimes!
Stand with us, march with us, walk with us. EVERYONE is needed! Join us wherever you can join us from, if the walk is too long meet us enroute.

Why Lauderdale By The Sea?
Because they have sided with the corrupt, wannabe dictator, and are renaming a street after him! They do not care about anyone in our community and have demonstrated this by allowing their elected officials to dictate that the street will be renamed after the convicted Felon. Even after We The People stood up, spoke out and voted in majority against the renaming of one of OUR STREETS after a sexual abuser and friend of abusers.
We do NOT support nor enable this administration nor their violent terroristic government funded ICE agents nor their delusional, weak, cowardly leader. We do not support business&apos; that support them either!
While not all of LBTS stands by this attack on our community, our families, our friends, our loved ones, MANY DO!!!!
WE RESIST! WE SAY NO TO ALL FORMS OF OPPRESSION!
We are WE THE PEOPLE and WE SAY FUCK ALL FASCISTS!
F.A.F.O FOREVER AGAINST FASCIST OPPRESSION!

*A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*</p>

<h3>ICE OUT</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, January 31, 2026 at 6:00 PM UTC - 8:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>I-75 Estero Parkway Overpass Bridge<br>1500 Estero Pkwy<br>Fort Myers, FL 33913</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Visibility Brigade is joining the nationwide ICE OUT event on Saturday January 31st from 1pm to 3pm on the Interstate 75 Estero Parkway Overpass Bridge. The address is 1500 Estero Parkway, Fort Myers, FL. 33913. 

Signs must be HUGE to be seen by interstate traffic below. 16-inch letters OR BIGGER recommended. The bigger, the better. (My signs have 19-inch letters, for example.) Flags are always welcome. 

Park on the EAST side of the bridge, on either side of the road, in the grass. 

(10-15 minute walk UPHILL to reach the top of the bridge.)

We need help attaching signs to the fencing if you can arrive early (12pm). 

Note: If you bring regular-sized signs, you will need to face the traffic on Estero Parkway, instead of facing interstate traffic. There is not much traffic on Estero Parkway. Recommend bringing HUGE signs for interstate traffic. You can spray paint 20-inch letters on a king size bed sheet and use bungee cords to attach the sheet to the fencing, for example.

If you can, bring a whistle in case ICE shows up. (Not expected, but as a precaution.)

*A core principle behind all Indivisible/Visibility Brigade events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*</p>

<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 21, 2026 at 5:00 PM UTC - 7:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Cornerstone United Methodist<br>8200 Immokalee Rd<br>Naples, FL 34119</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>This is a **Indivisible Gambit SWFL** event!
Indivisible Gambit SWFL, in collaboration with the **ACLU of Florida, Florida Immigration Coalition, Unidos Immokalee, and Voices of Bonita**, is taking action — and we invite you to join us.

Across our communities, many people are *feeling anxious, uncertain, and afraid.* That reaction **is normal.** Fear is often the goal of authoritarian systems: to isolate us, silence us, and make us feel powerless. But **courage is a choice** and choosing courage together is how we protect one another and how we win.

We invite you to join us

 **Saturday, February 21, 2026, 12:00–2:00 PM** for a Community Education and Organizing event at:

**Cornerstone United Methodist Church**
8200 Immokalee Road
Naples, FL 34119-9718

This gathering is designed to expand our outreach and strengthen local support networks by sharing practical, life-saving information and building community capacity.

At this event, participants will:

* Learn practical ways to stay safe and understand their rights
* Recognize and respond to concerning ICE activity
* Learn how volunteer legal observers educate community members and document encounters
* Get involved in rapid response, neighborhood watch efforts, and mutual aid
* Discover ways to support at-risk migrant families with basic needs

We are also actively recruiting and training:

* Volunteer legal observers
* Rapid responders
* Neighborhood watch volunteers
* Community members willing to assist with mutual aid

No one should face these moments alone. When we show up for each other informed, organized, and courageous we build real safety and real power.

We hope you’ll join us, bring a friend, and be part of this growing network of care, courage, and community defense.

*A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*</p>

<h3>#IceOUT Campaign National Organizing Call</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Thursday, February 5, 2026 at 5:00 PM UTC - 6:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> ResistTrump Campaign</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has become a pillar of fear, surveillance, and authoritarian control. Communities across the U.S. are pushing back through lawful, nonviolent protest to expose ICE’s abuses and resist its presence in our neighborhoods.

Every week, the ResistTrump Campaign (www.resisttrump.us) will convene organizers and activists on this national call to plan actions, share resources, and strengthen the movement to drive ICE out of our cities.

On this call, you’ll be able to connect with others who are:

- Leading or joining local ICE protest campaigns

- Learning effective, nonviolent tactics for resisting ICE facilities and operations

- Building solidarity with immigrant communities

- Coordinating creative actions that highlight ICE as a pillar of the Trump regime

This is your place to learn, collaborate, and take bold, lawful action. Together, we can resist ICE and weaken the authoritarian system it supports.</p>

<h3>Minnesota families: caucus to get ICE out of schools!</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, January 31, 2026 at 4:00 PM UTC - 5:30 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> TakeAction Minnesota</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Elections f**king matter, and everyday people like us have a powerful role to play in determining which candidates get a huge leg up in their race. From school board members to elected prosecutors to the governor, we deserve politicians who actually act to get ICE out of our schools, and who deliver the housing for all, food support, universal pre-K, and universal health care -- and more! -- that our families and communities deserve. 

We&apos;re getting trained in how to get politicians to deliver.

At this training you&apos;ll learn and practice how to show up where your voice has outsize power: precinct caucuses. (&quot;Precinct caucus&quot; is a gatekeeping phrase that means &quot;neighborhood meeting.&quot; These meetings happen all over Minnesota the evening of Feb 3, 2026.) 

The decisions everyday people make at this meeting determine which candidates get &quot;endorsed&quot; by a political party -- and get all all the votes, resources, and support that come with an endorsement. 

We&apos;ll learn what precinct caucus is, why it matters, and how we can show up to make sure that only #FamiliesOverBillionaires and #ICEout candidates get what they need to run competitive races.</p>

<h3>NO ICE NO FEAR</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 21, 2026 at 3:00 PM UTC - 5:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Collier County Courthouse<br>3315 Tamiami Trl E<br>Naples, FL 34112</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>NO ICE NO FEAR is rally that refuses silence, submission and intimidation. We gather to confront a system that terrorizes families, shatters communities and rules through FEAR - to say, loudly and together, that we will not accept it.

A government that KIDNAPS, CAGES and KILLS peaceful people is not a democracy - it is a dictatorship. This rally is a call to abolish cruelty masquerading as law enforcement, to end raids &amp; deportations, and to defend the dignity &amp; humanity of immigrants without compromise.

We stand visible, unafraid and unapologetic:  Our communities will not be policed by fear and justice will not wait

*A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*</p>

<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Collier County Courthouse<br>3315 Tamiami Trl E<br>Naples, FL 34112</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>American Patriots in Minneapolis showed the nation what dedicated peaceful protesters can do. Despite the very present danger of ICE violence &amp; killings these American Heroes forced Trump to Back Down on the ICE Occupation of their city and got ICE Gruppenfuhrer Bovino removed from his command.  This is only a pause as the Trump Regime will come up with more Extremist Authoritarian actions to weaken our Democracy.  A coalition of pro-Democracy groups is stepping up together to carry out another far larger NO KINGS Day of rallies &amp; resistance to Dictatorship.  We need all those who care about the future of our nation &amp; its Democracy to join the millions of others that will be participating in this impactful event nationwide event.

<h3>ICE OUT OF MINNESOTA NOW!</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, January 31, 2026 at 5:00 PM UTC - 7:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>1300 W St Germain St 1300<br>St. Cloud, MN 56301</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Americans for Democracy</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>In honor of Renée Nicole Good and Alex Pretti, whose deaths have deeply shaken our community and sparked widespread calls for justice, we are gathering to stand together against the harmful tactics of ICE and federal immigration enforcement. These losses — and the continued presence of armed agents in our cities — are unacceptable, and we demand that ICE remove its operations from our city, our state, and ultimately our country. �

This is a peaceful protest. We will consciously avoid confrontation, refuse to engage with provocation, and move forward with dignity and respect for one another. 

What is happening in Minneapolis and here in St. Cloud threatens our safety and our sense of community. We will not tolerate fear, violence, or militarization in our streets — and we will stand united for accountability, justice, and a future where all people are treated with humanity and respect. 
Renee and Alex will not be forgotten.

ICE — GET OUT OF MINNESOTA NOW!
Bring your signs.
Bring your voices.
Bring your ice scrapers.
Stand with your community.

We will be standing on the north side of Division closest to the library. If we have a large number of protesters we will utilize the south side.</p>

<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Customs and Border Protection Building (on sidewalk)<br>3770 Overseas Hwy<br>Marathon, FL 33050</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Middle Keys Democrats</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>EVERY Monday, 4:30-5:30 the Middle Keys (Marathon) will have a weekly rally on the  Gulf sidewalk of Overseas in front of the Customs and Border Protection building--3770 Overseas Hwy, Marathon. Do not park in the CBP parking lot. Park next door at a restaurant-or other parking.  Non immigrants have a moral duty to do what we can to shine a light on the illegal actions of our government. This is one way we can do it. Sign up so we can grow our protests and stop the illegal abduction of immigrants who came here lawfully and are now being violently kidnapped and detained in Alligator Alcatraz or similar. Denied basic rights lawful immigrants are transported to countries they have never lived in and are often tortured.</p>

<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Hackensack, MN<br>100 1st St S<br>Hackensack, MN 56452</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Minnesota DFL</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>This Constitutional Observer training will teach community members how to safely monitor and document interactions with law enforcement (like ICE). It will focus on upholding constitutional rights by observing from a safe distance, recording events, informing individuals of their rights, and providing support, not interfering, with goals of accountability and transparency for any unconstitutional actions. 

Walk away with tactical knowledge about how to be an upstanding Constitutional Observer - what to do (and what not to do). This training is for everyone, even those who do not plan to ever &quot;take to the streets&apos; as an observer.

Training will take place in person in Hackensack (MN). The specific location will be provided to those who register via this Mobilize event.

Register by noon on February 4 if you wish to join the training via Zoom. The Zoom link will be sent to those who register by this deadline.

A Cass County action planning session will follow the training for those who attend the training in person. The action planning session will not be available online.

Prepared and paid for by Cass County DFL, PO Box 276, Hackensack, MN 56452.</p>

<h3>SETX Impact Initiative: National Shutdown</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Friday, January 30, 2026 at 6:00 AM UTC - 6:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> SETX Impact Initiative</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>This is a national call for general strike - No work, no school, no shopping. Please only participate if you are safe doing so. SETX Impact Initiative is not directly involved in organizing this initiative. We are only helping to support it in the SETX area.

We are hoping our community will be a part of this too:

Somali and Black student organizations in Minneapolis are calling for a shutdown on Friday, January 30th, after the execution style murder of Alex Pretti by immigration officers. They&apos;re asking people across the country to support the call.

On January 20th, thousands of students across the country walked out to protest ICE terror in our communities, and to demand justice for Renee Nicole Good. Three days later, the people of Minnesota organized a powerful shutdown - No work, no school, no shopping.

This week, after Alex&apos;s murder and while congress is debating giving ICE even more money, it&apos;s time to take the movement to the next level. ICE has kidnapped our neighbors and classmates: they do not make our communities more safe. We demand ICE out for good!

On January 30th we will organize walk-outs and a national general strike across the country and stand in solidarity with immigrant communities in Minnesota and everywhere else.</p>

<h3>Stop I.C.E. For GOOD! Jan 31 TX-24 Solidarity Event</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, January 31, 2026 at 5:00 PM UTC - 6:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Apple Southlake Town Square<br>260 Grand Ave<br>Southlake, TX 76092</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible TX-24</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Show Up Time!  

Take a stand for democracy! Take a stand for Silverio Gonzalez. For Renee Good. For Carlos Jimenez, Marimar Martinez, and Alex Pretti. Just some of the names of people shot by Trump&apos;s DHS during immigration enforcement operations. 

The most recent shooting victim, that resulted in a death, was VA nurse, Alex Pretti of Minneapolis. Mr Pretti&apos;s final words were, “Are you OK?” 

America is not OK. ICE is out-of-control, terrorizing, injuring, and killing innocent people. This Saturday we will stand in solidarity with Minneapolis as we read the names of the innocent people who have been harmed by ICE. We will also protest to demand that Apple return the ICEBlock app to the Apple Store so communities can be safe from warrantless, violent ICE raids. 

Saturday is election day for voters in special election SD9. The Pretti Good protest is conveniently located just steps away from a polling place in Southlake Town Hall, Room 3A-3D, 1400 Main Street.

Showing up to vote and to protest are more important now than ever. Use your power and take a stand for democracy! 

Indivisible events are peaceful and practice de-escalation! Do not engage! Do not take the bait!</p>

<h3>Human Cost of ICE: A Memorial Protest and Banner Drop</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Sunday, February 8, 2026 at 5:00 PM UTC - 7:30 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>1422 N Loop 336 W<br>Conroe, TX 77304</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>This a local Indivisible event!
We are protesting because people are dying as a result of ICE enforcement and related policing, including deaths in ICE custody, deaths during enforcement actions, and innocent American citizens killed during law enforcement responses connected to immigration operations and protest activity.
These deaths are documented and preventable. No one involved was sentenced to death.
Participants are asked to bring a tombstone shaped sign with the name of a person who died in ICE custody, during enforcement, or during related policing actions. Each tombstone represents a real human life lost. Please dress in all black if you are able to. We will also have a banner drop on the 1-45 overpass where the protest will be taking place.
This is a peaceful demonstration demanding accountability, transparency, and respect for human life. 
There is nearby parking at 1422 N Loop 336 W, Conroe, TX. 77304. Please do not park in the Starbucks parking lot as your car will be towed.
We will be collecting non-perishable food items to benefit the local food bank Abundant Harvest.

<h3>ICE OUT For Good, La Porte TX</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, January 31, 2026 at 5:00 PM UTC - 7:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Five Points Town Plaza<br>100 S Broadway St<br>La Porte, TX 77571</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Hello Activists!!

With the increased uncertainty and temperatures in our country, it is more important than ever to create community, bond together and show the authoritarian regime that the power lies with the people!

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is killing American Citizens and it is part of a broader pattern of unchecked violence, impunity, and abuse carried out by federal immigration enforcement agencies against members of our communities.

We will not sit idly by while our neighbors live in fear.

We will not be quiet while our neighbors are being murdered in the streets.

This peaceful demonstration of democracy will take place at Five Points Plaza in La Porte, TX, and similar to the No Kings rally, we will be working one on one with our city officials to ensure the safety of their residents.

Bring flowers, instruments, kazoos, bubbles, anything to spread joy and show this administration we are NOT HOPELESS.

Thanks for spreading the word and we are so excited to see all of you on the streets again!

*****A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*****


Location: Five Points Plaza in La Porte, TX 
105 San Jacinto St. La Porte TX, 77571 
Date: Saturday, January 31st, 2026 
Time: 11am to 1pm

<h3>ICE OUT PROTEST AND VIGIL</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, January 31, 2026 at 10:00 PM UTC - 1:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Shepler Square Park<br>406 W Gore Blvd<br>Lawton, OK 73501</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> VETERANS UNITED FOR ACTION</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>I am angry. I know you are too. And I’m scared.

What’s happening in Minneapolis will spread, unless we work to stop it.

NSPM-7 (National Security Presidential Memorandum) designates people like you and me, like Renee Good and Alex Pretti, as “the enemy within.” 

ICE and CBP will murder, brutalize, kidnap and detain peaceful protesters, legal observers, people just trying to take their kid to school or go to work, and Kristi Noem and Stephen Miller will automatically call them “domestic terrorists.”

These protesters are trying to protect immigrants, and people who LOOK like immigrants, from being kidnapped by ICE, unlawfully detained, brutalized, and deported. Immigrants and U.S. Citizens are subject to their “shoot first, ask questions later” tactics.

We are told not to believe what we saw.

We are told not to resist.

But we must. We are angry, but we MUST stay peaceful. The regime wants an excuse to invoke the Insurrection Act and martial law. We cannot give it to them.

If it weren’t for our winter storm, we’d be out there today protesting. But next weekend’s weather will be 52 degrees. Come to Shepler Park, 4th and Gore, Sat. Jan 31.

From 4-6 pm we will protest. Bring signs, bullhorns, chants, songs, and your passion for justice.

At 6 pm we will hold a vigil. Bring battery-powered candles, small flashlights, or cell phones or other lights. Please do not bring anything with a flame. I will have several battery candles for those who don’t have any.

During the vigil, if someone wants to pray, we will pray. If someone wants to speak, we will listen. If someone wants to read a poem or lead us in a song, we will support. 

We must be non-violent. Do not bring weapons of any kind, except for your voices.

The City of Lawton has an ordinance that requires a paid permit for any assembly (specifically protests) of more than 24 people. Keep that in mind. 

The City Council will address our opposition to this ordinance on Tues. Jan. 27 at the end of their meeting. If you want to speak during Audience Participation on this or any topic of concern, be sure you have submitted a Request to Speak BEFORE the meeting starts. Submit to the city clerk either at the meeting or email to her (and be sure she responds that she has received it.)

https://mobilize.us/s/Mg9M9L for detailed information about the agenda items and how to participate.

You can also do your own protest/vigil at other visible locations. 38th and Gore has easy parking and good traffic, for one.

To learn about successful non-violent resistance, watch the short documentaries in this series, particularly the first one on the Civil Rights Movement: https://www.mobilize.us/indivisible/event/878852/ 

Heather Cox Richardson explains it in her usual level-headed, well-researched fashion. Listen and weep. Then get up and go to work saving democracy.

A great protest song:
https://youtu.be/4PUOhAJG5EU?si=cn-lhMIDFr5qfgz4 (Thanks, Al G.!)

Please let me know if you have any ideas about the protest or the vigil. 

Let’s keep making Good Trouble.</p>

<h3>ICE Out For Good New Braunfels</h3>

<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>301 Main Plaza<br>New Braunfels, TX 78130</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Wednesday, January 7th, an American citizen was killed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Minneapolis, Minnesota. This killing is part of a broader pattern of unchecked violence, impunity, and abuse carried out by federal immigration enforcement agencies against members of our communities. 

A broad coalition of groups across the country is calling for a coordinated Ice Out For Good Weekend of Action on Saturday, January 10th and Sunday, January 11th to demand accountability, honor the life lost, and make visible the human cost of ICE’s actions. 

A core principle behind all ICE Out For Good events is a commitment to nonviolent action and no civil disobedience. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values, and to act lawfully at these events. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events. All events should be held in public spaces or on public property.

Indivisible is managing data and communications with participants. By registering, you agree to receive info from Indivisible about the event, receive communications via e-mail or SMS message from Indivisible, and receive any other updates and opportunities to take action or support ICE OUT FOR GOOD partner organizations. You also agree to have any data entered in this registration collected by Indivisible.

Sidewalk Protest

Bring your signs and stand in solidarity with us to show Douglas County that we will not be silenced by the regime&apos;s terror tactics.

<h3>Signs of Solidarity-Feb. 15 at Florida &amp; Dahlia-Business KYR Training/Canvass</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Sunday, February 15, 2026 at 8:00 PM UTC - 10:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Virginia Village Library<br>1500 S Dahlia St<br>Denver, CO 80222</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Denver Action</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Our hearts are broken by the events in Minneapolis.  We are upset with the unlawful actions of federal agents there.  We will not sit idly by and wait for that chaos to be visited on the Denver area.

Join us to be trained to canvass local businesses and to share with them Know Your Rights information to help them protect themselves and their employees in case of a raid by ICE. We share with them the importance of making a plan, training employees and creating safe spaces, and we suggest what employees should or should not do. We tell them how to report wrong doing by ICE and CBP.  At the end attendees will have the opportunity to canvass local businesses.

Canvassing is a demonstration of our solidarity with all of our Denver community and has been received warmly by the businesses visited.</p>

<h3>Love Not Fear: Stop Palantir - Valentine’s Day Sidewalk Action</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 14, 2026 at 7:00 PM UTC - 9:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Cherry Creek North<br>2nd and Detroit<br>Denver, CO 80206</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Denver Action</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>This Valentine’s Day, we’re choosing love over fear.

Palantir’s multi-million-dollar contracts with ICE power surveillance and data platforms that drive detention, deportation, workplace raids, and family separation. These technologies spread fear through our neighborhoods and harm immigrant communities.

Join us for a peaceful sidewalk action outside Palantir headquarters to say clearly: Do not work with ICE – Cancel all contracts.

Bring your heart, your voice, and your commitment to justice. Signs and chants welcome. 

A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.</p>

<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>🔥❄️ MELT SOME ICE ❄️🔥 and Release the Epstein Files

Join Solidarity Warriors and Colorado Bridge Trolls for another epic overpass protest on the Highlands Bridge in Denver!

We’re taking the high ground—literally—to demand an end to ICE’s cruelty🔥❄️ and to call for the full release of the Epstein files 📂. We will not tolerate distractions. We carry both grief for those recently killed by federal agents and fierce determination to build something better all at once.

This is a visible, peaceful, high-energy action designed to cut through the noise and force accountability from institutions that rely on silence and impunity. 
We stand in Solidarity and outrage at the latest deaths at the hands of ICE and federal agents — both in and out of custody — incidents that have ignited nationwide outrage and calls for accountability and justice.

📍 WHERE: Highlands Bridge Pedestrian Overpass. Use 1596 Central St., Denver, for GPS.

⏰ WHEN: Saturday, January 31st, 1 PM – 3 PM.
 
We’ll fill the bridge with solidarity, music, dancing, and coordinated visuals so our demands can’t be ignored.

What to expect:
•	Peaceful, highly-visible, overpass protest ✊We’ll bring signs and letters large enough to be seen from the highway.
•	Music, dancing, and community energy 🎶💃🕺
•	Creativity, joy, and unapologetic accountability 🔥

What to bring:
•	Signs and banners (big, readable, weather-ready) 🪧
•	Costumes encouraged! 🐸
•	Layers for the weather 🧥
•	Your people 🫂

This action is about pressure, visibility, collective power, and celebrating joy in the face of loss and systemic violence. 

Joy is resistance! ✨💃🕺

Show up. Be seen. 🔥❄️ Melt some ICE ❄️🔥. Release the files.

*Music will be playing from speakers along the bridge. If it’s too loud where you are, just step a bit down the bridge—the sound doesn’t travel far.

*A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*</p>

<h3>SPEAK YOUR PEACE – STAND UP FOR RENEE GOOD AND ALEX PRETTI!</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, January 31, 2026 at 6:00 PM UTC - 8:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>South Santa Fe Drive &amp; West Bowles Avenue<br>Littleton, CO 80120</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Two brave Americans have been gunned down on the streets of Minneapolis by masked ICE agents. Over the weekend, two panicked ICE agents opened fire on Alex Pretti, a hospital ER nurse, after he was disarmed and pinned on the ground by other agents. We can’t mince words. It was a summary execution.

That tragic event followed the killing of Renee Good two weeks earlier by an angry, out-of-control ICE agent, who cursed at her after firing his deadly shots.

Those murders are just two of the 12 shooting incidents involving immigration officers since September, which included the killings of Silverio Gonzalez in Illinois and Isaias Barboza in Texas.

Donald Trump has deployed those strongarms into our cities to terrorize immigrants and intimidate the rest of us. Kristi Noem has wasted no time in telling lies to the American public in order to justify the murders of those two decent Minnesotans.

On Saturday, January 31 – the day after funding for DHS and ICE runs out – we will take to the street from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. to demand justice for Renee Good and Alex Pretti. ICE activities in our cities must be rescinded. Funding for ICE must be curtailed or abolished.  The murders of Good and Pretti must be fully investigated and prosecuted.

Bring your signs! Bring your flags! Bring your message! Let’s restore peace and justice to our cities!

<h3>BI - Drop Your ICE Contracts</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 28, 2026 at 9:00 PM UTC - 10:30 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>BI Corporate Headquarters<br>6265 Gunbarrel Ave Suite B<br>Boulder, CO 80301</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> SoBoCo Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>In 2025, ICE paid BI Incorporated over $171.5 million for their electronic monitoring or “e-carceration” tools. That includes a secretive $1.6 million
contract for a bounty hunter-like service called “skip tracing”, where BI Incorporated tracks the locations of immigrants in their communities for ICE ERO. They are currently owned by GEO which is a private prison company that runs the Aurora Concentration Camp for detainees.

Join us outside BI&apos;s Boulder County offices to let them know we do not want businesses here that support ICE! We demand BI drop those contracts!!!</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
<h3>Rally with AJDems ICE OUT FOR GOOD</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 7, 2026 at 3:00 PM UTC - 6:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Apache Juction Marker<br>South Phelps Drive &amp; East Old West Highway<br>Apache Junction, AZ 85119</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Pinal County Democratic Party</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>The Ice Out for Good Rally is not a quiet gathering — it’s a surge of collective power. This is where people who are tired of being ignored, dismissed, or frozen out of the political process come together to melt the old barriers and ignite something new. The rally channels frustration into purpose, turning cold discontent into blazing determination. Voices rise, energy builds, and the message is unmistakable: communities are done waiting for change. They’re ready to demand it.

This event is a rallying cry for everyone who refuses to sit on the sidelines. It’s a space for bold ideas, unapologetic passion, and the kind of unity that shakes the ground beneath complacency. Attendees will connect with organizers who are pushing for fairness, accountability, and a political future shaped by people — not by apathy or inertia. Ice Out for Good is about breaking through the freeze, lighting a fire under civic engagement, and pushing forward with unstoppable momentum. This is the moment to stand up, speak out, and fuel a movement that refuses to cool down.

Meet at our usual corner of Phelps and Old West Hwy. in Apache Junction from 8am-11am. Please stay hydrated and bring water. :-) PLEASE PARK IN THE DIRT LOT ON THE NORTHEAST CORNER OF PHELPS AND OLD WEST HWY.</p>

        <name>Pinal County Board of Sup. Meeting</name>
        <description><![CDATA[
<h3>Pinal County Board of Sup. Meeting</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Wednesday, February 4, 2026 at 4:30 PM UTC - 8:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>135 N Pinal St<br>Florence, AZ 85132</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Queen Creek San Tan Valley Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Once again, Brad Miller, Pinal County Attorney, has expressed his determination to enter an agreement with ICE under a Task Force Enforcement MOU.  The county board of supervisors consulted their attorneys twice, and on January 21st, they publicly heard from their attorney, who stated unequivocally that the county does not have the legal authority to enter a law enforcement agreement with ICE.  They voted to continue the MOU for the Jail Enforcement Model that has been in place for at least 5 years.  We have a copy of the MOU from March 2020, but Sheriff Teeple, who was unclear about the dates, said that there was one in place earlier as well.  Either way, the Jail Enforcement Model is much more limited, allowing deputies to turn over a criminal upon their release from jail if they are &quot;removable&quot;.  

The Task Force Model is the one we began seeing on our streets beginning in August.  This model seemed to use PCSO to pull over people of color, take their time to give a ticket while they waited for ICE, then monitor the situation, assist, and protect ICE during the abduction.  We have not seen this type of law enforcement stop since the county began consulting attorneys on the matter.  With ICE descending upon our state as I type, we do not want Brad Miller to unleash the Task Force Model on our neighborhoods again.  During the time he was illegally cooperating with ICE from August through January, I personally saw 3 stops in and near my neighborhood.  They were agressive and one of the people detained was an American.

<h3>Shut Out ICE - Shutdown and Protest - Lake County MT</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, January 31, 2026 at 7:00 PM UTC - 9:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Montana Highway 35 &amp; US Highway 93 N Bound<br>Lake County, MT 59860</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>The people of the Twin Cities have shown the way for the whole country – to stop ICE’s reign of terror, we need to SHUT IT DOWN. 

On Friday, January 30, join a nationwide day of no school, no work and no shopping.  https://nationalshutdown.org/

On Saturday January 31st join us from Noon-2PM at the intersection of MT Hwy 35 and US Hwy 93 for a protest concerning ICE&apos;s recent actions.

The entire country is shocked and outraged at the brutal killings of Alex Pretti, Renee Good, Silverio Villegas González, and Keith Porter Jr. by federal agents. While Trump and other right wing politicians are slandering them as “terrorists”, the video evidence makes it clear beyond all doubt: they were gunned down in broad daylight simply for exercising their First Amendment right to protest mass deportation. Every day, ICE, Border Patrol and other enforcers of Trump’s racist agenda are going into our communities to kidnap our neighbors and sow fear. It is time for us to all stand up together in a nationwide shutdown and say enough is enough!

Please be respectful of the surrounding businesses, now that the restaurant has re-opened we will need to park elsewhere around the area.

This a local Indivisible event!

*A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
<h3>Stop the Wars &amp; ICE Raids, Recuse Biggs, &amp; Show Us the Files</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Wednesday, February 11, 2026 at 10:00 PM UTC - 12:30 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>East Southern Avenue &amp; Power Road<br>Mesa, AZ 85206</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Mesa Valley Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>## ⚖️ Stop the Wars, Stop the Raids, Recuse Biggs, &amp; Show Us the Files

The opening weeks of 2026 have been defined by a sudden and aggressive shift in executive policy, marked by the military capture of Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela and a deadly surge in domestic ICE operations. Political analysts, congressional critics, and [Mesa Valley Indivisible](https://www.mesavalleyindivisible.org/) argue that these actions are not independent strategies, but rather a **governance by distraction** tactic intended to divert public attention from the Department of Justice’s stalling on the Epstein Files Transparency Act.

This standoff has intensified following the release of the explosive allegations by Sascha (Sasha) Riley, which names several high-profile figures, including **Representative Andy Biggs (R-AZ)** who is a key member of the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability. **Rep. Biggs** alleged connection to the files creates a profound conflict of interest, casting doubt on whether the Oversight Committee can impartially investigate a network that may implicate its own members.

📢 **Join [Mesa Valley Indivisible](https://www.mesavalleyindivisible.org/) **AGAIN** on Wednesday, February 11th in protesting against the distractionary wars in Venezuela &amp; the ICE raids across America while also demanding the release of the unredacted Epstein Files and recusal of Representative Andy Biggs!**


### 🆘Key Concerns Driving the Protest:

- **The Illegal War in Venezuela:** Just as the heat on the Epstein files reached a breaking point, the administration launched Operation Absolute Resolve. What is being sold as a &quot;strategic task&quot; is an illegal war for regime change and oil. They are trading the lives of soldiers and Venezuelans to create a decisive headline that buries their criminal scandals at home.

- **The Invasion of Our Neighborhoods:** The 120% surge in ICE manpower is not about safety; it is about keeping Americans in a permanent state of crisis. By flooding our streets with 12,000 new agents and conducting high-visibility raids, the administration is trying to keep the public focused on a manufactured domestic emergency so we stop asking who is on the Epstein list.

- **Release the Epstein Files**: We demand the immediate, unredacted public release of all federal files, client lists, and documents related to Jeffrey Epstein. We reject the notion that privacy can be used as a shield to protect powerful perpetrators and co-conspirators.

- **The Andy Biggs &amp; Sascha Riley Cover-Up:** We demand answers regarding the testimony of Sascha Riley. While Representative Andy Biggs poses as a champion of fact-driven transparency on the Oversight Committee, Riley’s claims suggest a much darker connection. You cannot oversee an investigation into your own associates. We demand an immediate, independent inquiry into these allegations.

### 🚩Our Demands:

**1. The Full, Unredacted Epstein Files:** Release all 5.2 million pages of the Epstein files immediately.

**2. An End to the War for Oil:** Withdraw troops from Venezuela and cease the regime change narrative.

**3. The Removal of Surge Forces:** End the ICE neighborhood invasions and return to the rule of law.

**4. The Investigation of Andy Biggs:** A public hearing on the Sascha Riley allegations. No more protection for the Oversight Committee.


### 🚨Important! 
Before the protest, please make sure to contact our governments offices and tell them your demands by [clicking this link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oDkJ3MY1nNap_fhzK8K8pTSWYg53Vsk9hBXcN0LkER0/edit?usp=sharing) – you will be provided with the contact phone numbers, email, addresses, websites, etc. and scripts for each. 


### 🪧Signs &amp; Messaging
Ideas for signs include: 
✅ Where are the Files?
✅ Abolish ICE. Release Files. Lose Biggs
✅ Release the Epstein Files
✅ Believe Sascha Riley

        <description><![CDATA[
<h3>ICE OUT FOR GOOD</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, January 31, 2026 at 5:00 PM UTC - 6:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>West Esperanza Boulevard &amp; North La Cañada Drive<br>Green Valley, AZ 85614</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> We the People R Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Alex Jeffrey Pretti and Renée Good—both 37-year-old American citizens—were fatally shot this month in separate incidents involving federal immigration agents in Minneapolis.
 
Pretti was a compassionate ICU nurse at the Minneapolis VA Health Care System, killed on January 24, 2026, while Good, a writer, poet, and mother of three, was killed on January 7, 2026 when an ICE agent opened fire during an enforcement action.
 
Please join us on Saturday, January 31, at the La Canada/Esperanza intersection in Green Valley for a rally demanding justice for Alex Pretti and Renée Good. Their deaths at the hands of federal immigration agents have sparked grief and righteous anger across the country. Their deaths are not isolated, they are a call for accountability, for justice, and for a future where no one is shot for exercising their rights or trying to protect someone else. Bring your heart and your voice. Let’s show that our community refuses to be silent.  We demand accountability. We demand change. 
 
PLEASE REMEMBER:    All of our protests are peaceful. Do not engage with agitators or anyone attempting to provoke conflict.  Stay calm, step away, and keep each other safe.</p>

<h3>Join Mesa Valley Indivisible to Protest ICE Deportations &amp; the AROCC Detention Center</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 21, 2026 at 4:00 PM UTC - 7:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>South Gilbert Road &amp; East Broadway Road<br>Mesa, AZ 85204</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Mesa Valley Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>## 🛫 ICE &amp; AROCC: Stop ICE operations at Mesa Gateway Airport!

For the past eight months, [Mesa Valley Indivisible](https://www.mesavalleyindivisible.org/) members and a coalition of groups around the country have been working relentlessly to end Avelo Airlines’ involvement in the unlawful and inhumane deportation of primarily non‑violent immigrants via Mesa Gateway Airport. 

Americans dedicated to ending Avelo&apos;s contract with ICE boycotted, protested, emailed and called our representatives/senators, held weekly meetings, etc. and on January 7, 2026, news broke that Avelo Airlines announced they were ending their ICE deportation flights!!

As we all celebrate this **HUGE WIN**, we also know ICE deportation flights are still occurring at the Mesa Gateway Airport &amp; the AROCC detention center remains active on the grounds. We can happily check off Avelo Airlines now, but it is time to move on to the next challenge which is ending ICE deportation flights &amp; closing the AROCC at our Mesa Gateway Airport! 

## 📢Join us on Saturday, February 21st, to challenge the use of the local airport for what are illegal, inhumane, and unconstitutional removal operations.

### 🆘Key Concerns Driving the Protest:

- **Corporate Complicity in Inhumane Practices**: These deportations are driven by profit and political patronage. Private contractors run detention and flight operations through non‑commercial hubs, creating durable infrastructure that outlasts elections. The incentive loop is clear: **more arrests → more funding → more capacity → more bodies.**


- **Conditions on the Ground**: Individuals slated for deportation or transfer are held in a secluded facility at the Mesa airport—near where commercial travelers dine—where they are reportedly kept without access to basic amenities like beds or showers until their flight.


- **Inhumane Treatment on Flights**: Documentation over years has shown that passengers on these flights are typically shackled for the entire duration, denied bathroom access, and subjected to severe abuse, including beatings, restrictive restraints, and reports of deaths and miscarriages.


- **Secrecy and Lack of Transparency**: Aircraft are often disguised through subcontractors and subleases, and the flights themselves are secretive and unmarked, shielding the carriers and the airport from public scrutiny.


### 🪧Signs &amp; Graphics

Please create signs and graphics that are relevant to ICE deportations &amp; the AROCC! Some ideas include:

* Abolish ICE
* ICE separates families
*42 days does not = temporary
* Illegal deportations without due process is human trafficking


###  ⚠️Protest Information

🚗 Parking is available around the intersection 

⭐ Please share with friends, family, neighbors, EVERYONE!

📸 When posting photos/videos online, please make sure to tag the Mesa Valley Indivisible social media page and clearly state Mesa Valley Indivisible as the protest organizer. The goal is to raise our group&apos;s profile which will make it easier for new people to find &amp; join our community while also increasing our influence with government officials and the media! In order to have a greater impact on our city, people have to know we exist first!!

Why we are gathering:

To Remember: We will read the names of those who have died in detention or during enforcement actions, ensuring their stories are not forgotten.

To Call for Reform: We are raising our voices to end the 287(g) agreement in Pinal County, which erodes trust and undermines the dignity of our immigrant neighbors.

To Stand in Unity: This gathering will feature blessings from diverse faith leaders and speakers from multiple generations to demonstrate our community&apos;s shared commitment to justice.

What to bring: We encourage you to bring LED candles and photos of loved ones to add to our community altar.

Accessibility &amp; Safety: This is a peaceful, nonviolent witness for justice. We will remain on public land and ensure the space is accessible to all. Please dress for the evening weather in Florence.</p>

<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>ICE OUT EVERYWHERE: Prescott Indivisible Protest

 Join Prescott Indivisible on the corner of Gurley &amp; Montezuma on Saturday January 31 @ 2PM 

Our community refuses to look away from the harm ICE inflicts on families, neighbors, and people seeking safety.
We’re showing up again to keep the pressure on, to stand with immigrant communities, and to demand a future rooted in dignity, fairness, and human rights.

A core principle behind all ICE Out For Good events is a commitment to nonviolent action and no civil disobedience. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values, and to act lawfully at these events. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events. All events should be held in public spaces or on public property.</p>

<h3>Rein in ICE: Meet your Police Chief or Sheriff.  How To Set Up A Meeting.</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, January 31, 2026 at 4:00 PM UTC - 5:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>We have a tried and true process for landing a meeting with your local officials, and how to run that meeting to press for outcomes that Rein In ICE.  

Come to this training to learn specific steps you can take right now to make this happen in your city or community, quickly.

1) communicate with allies - see who is already doing it.  but dont wait.
2) assemble a list of people willing to have their name and email publicly on a message
3) email ALL the council members/supervisors AND all the emails you can find for the target, AND copy over 20 constituents publicly
4) have people call in and make noise and follow up if you don&apos;t get an answer
5) they will respond.  schedule the meeting, be polite and professional if they are responding to you. be noisy if they are not.
6) plan the talking points down to the minute for the meeting.  

There&apos;s a bit more, but that&apos;s the main part.  We&apos;ll go thru these steps and how to accomplish them, and tell our experiences doing this process successfully.

Hope to see you there, wherever you are.  I put this in Phoenix because it may be on the next target list, but everyone welcome from any location.

<h3>Rush-hour Resistance Rally @ ICE Field Office in Phoenix</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Thursday, February 5, 2026 at 2:30 PM UTC - 3:30 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>2035 N Central Ave<br>Phoenix, AZ 85004</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Desert Democracy</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p># Welcome to the Rush-hour Resistance!


📣 [Rush Hour Resistance Rally](https://rhrr.us) began with a clear idea: **neighbors, gathering peacefully and regularly on busy nearby streets, could remind our communities that democracy is essential and that silence is unacceptable.** Over the last year, RhRR expanded from a handful of participants to multiple locations across the Valley, reaching thousands of pedestrians and motorists each week. This momentum is significant, as is the duty it brings.


🗳️ As we approach the midterm elections, our united mission is to safeguard free and fair elections and promote civic participation, particularly in local and primary races where every vote carries weight. **Our weekly rallies are more than outlets for frustration; they are consistent, visible commitments that normalize voting and democratic engagement as neighborly expectations.**


🕊️ RhRR is a peaceful, nonconfrontational movement. **Our goal is to reach the broader community, not to confront those seeking conflict.** When tensions surface, we withdraw, stay composed, and look out for one another. This discipline keeps our rallies inviting and helps newcomers feel secure joining us.


🫂 Most of all, RhRR is about people caring for one another while standing up for the future of our democracy. **Every person who shows up, every sign held, and every conversation sparked on a street corner is part of something larger and deeply hopeful.**


## Here’s what’s in store for our Thursday morning event in the Museum District, right in front of the ICE Field Office:


🕥 The event starts at 7:30 am. You are free to show up anytime, but we recommend arriving a few minutes early to introduce yourself. We end promptly at 8:30 am.

⚠️ There are many other groups protesting at that location all day, every Thursday. Some aren&apos;t quite as committed to being peaceful and nonconfrontational. RhRR only takes the first shift. What happens after is beyond our purview. 


🅿️ Parking is a bit of a challenge. Some of us park on Holly St, directly across from the ICE Field Office. We haven’t had issues before, but parking enforcement is unpredictable. If concerned, take the light rail. 


🖌️ One of RhRR’s strengths is that people feel free to express themselves. For this ICE-specific event, your signs will be focused on protecting neighbors and communities. Strong anti-ICE signs are always welcome. You may bring other signs that help articulate any of our three pillars:


- **Defending democracy and the rule of law**
- **Encouraging voting**
- **Protecting neighbors and communities** (e.g., immigrants, LGBTQIA+ people, workers, and veterans)


This approach keeps signs aligned with RhRR’s purpose, while preserving personal expression and emotional authenticity.  


🇺🇳 Flags, banners, and even inflatable costumes are welcome. Some blow lots of bubbles. While our mission is serious, humor and camaraderie matter.


😷 RhRRs are peaceful, public events. Most attendees don’t hide their faces, though some do; participate at your comfort level. Photos and videos are common on social media, but you can ask posters to remove accidental appearances.


Thanks in advance for joining us. See you on the streets! ✊Votin</p>

<h3>❌🧊 ICE OUT for Good - Weekly Protest in Surprise AZ</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, January 31, 2026 at 4:00 PM UTC - 5:30 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Bell Road &amp; North Civic Center Drive<br>Surprise, AZ 85374</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Northwest Valley Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>### **Weekly Protest: Stop ICE Overreach**

📍 **Bell Rd &amp; Civic Center Dr, Surprise, AZ**  
🕘 **Every Saturday | 9:00–10:30 AM**

We are protesting weekly in Surprise in response to the ongoing overreach of ICE in Minnesota, across the country, and right here in Arizona.

*A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values and to act lawfully at these events. Weapons of any kind should not be brought to events.*

As residents of **Arizona’s 8th Congressional District**, we are calling on our representative, **Abe Hamadeh**, to publicly address and oppose federal enforcement actions that endanger civil rights and community safety. Protecting constituents from government overreach is a core responsibility of elected office.

**Our demands:**

- No new funding for ICE without real reform  
- Investigate the killings of Renee Good &amp; Alex Pretti
- End aggressive dragnet operations and mass surveillance  
- Restore transparency, accountability, and due process  

**Suggested messages for signs:**

- NO ICE FACILITY IN SURPRISE  
- JUSTICE FOR RENEE GOOD  
- JUSTICE FOR ALEX PRETTI  
- FREEZE ICE FUNDING  
- END ICE NOW  
- BELIEVE YOUR EYES NOT TRUMP’S LIES  
- NO ICE IN AZ  
- DUE PROCESS FOR ALL  

This protest is rooted in **nonviolence, clarity, and solidarity**. We welcome community members who believe no agency should operate above the law and that state power must be constrained by constitutional rights and public oversight.

**Bring signs, bring water, and bring your voice.**

**Parking:** Plenty of parking is available on the south side of Bell Rd. Please stay out of the urgent care parking lot at the corner and avoid parking near business entrances.

**Peaceful protest. No violence. No harassment. No escalation.**

As frontline essential workers in healthcare, home care and the public sector, we provide care and critical services to every person we serve with humanity, dignity and compassion.
Join SEIU Local 1107 members in honoring Alex Pretti and all who have been murdered by ICE, as well as demand that congress vote to immediately abolish this violent, racist, and lawless agency that poses a dire public health threat to all of our communities.

Alex Pretti, an intensive care unit nurse in Minneapolis, approached his work with the same spirit and compassion that we all bring to our professions. Alex, an AFGE union member, in service to his community, was violently brought to the ground, pepper-sprayed and shot in the back multiple times by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. Members of SEIU 1107 mourn the loss of a fellow care provider, union member and advocate for all.</p>

<h3>FEB 6th! - Handmaids of LV - ICE OUT NOW! Downtown Las Vegas 3pm</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Friday, February 6, 2026 at 11:00 PM UTC - 12:30 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>ICE OFFICE - Downtown Las Vegas<br>501 Las Vegas Blvd S<br>Las Vegas, NV 89101</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Handmaids Las Vegas</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Join the Handmaids of Las Vegas: ICE Out for GOOD - We Stand With Minnesota!

Dear compassionate souls of Las Vegas,

Wednesday, January 7, 2026 an American citizen was killed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement )ICE) in Minneapolis, Minnesota and now another life, Alex Pretti, has been taken by ICE. These killings are part of a broader pattern of unchecked violence, impunity and abuse carried out by federal immigration enforcement agencies against members of our communities.

A broad coalition of groups across the country is calling for a coordinated solidarity actions to stand and say ICE OUT FOR GOOD! with Minnesota, and to demand accountability, honor the lives lost, and make visible the human cost of ICE&apos;s actions.

A core principle behind all ICE Out events is a commitment to nonviolent action and no civil disobedience. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values, and to act lawfully at these events. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events. All events should be held in public spaces or on public property. Handmaids of Las Vegas are managing data and communications with participants. By registering for this event, you agree to receive info from the Handmaids of Las Vegas about the event, receive communications via email and/or SMS messages, and receive any other updates and opportunities to take action or support ICE OUT STANDS AND PARCHES. You also agree to have any data entered in this registration collected by Handmaids of Las Vegas. We will treat your data according to our organizations privacy policy.

We invite you to join the Handmaids of Las Vegas as we unite in a powerful demonstration of solidarity for immigrant rights. On February 6, 2026, we will gather every other Friday at the ICE Offices in Downtown Las Vegas. Our stands will take place from 3pm PM to 4:30 PM, where we will stand together, clad in the iconic red uniforms of the handmaids, to echo the call for justice and equality.

A Stand for Dignity and Humanity Under the current Trump regime, immigrants and people of color have faced cruel and inhumane treatment. Families have been torn apart, and countless individuals have been subjected to unjust policies that strip away their dignity and rights. We believe that every person deserves to be treated with respect and compassion, regardless of their background or origin.

How You Can Show Support Join Us: Wear red and stand with us in solidarity. Your presence will amplify our message and show that our community stands united.

Donate: Bring non-perishable food and clothing to help support our local community. Your contributions make a significant difference in the lives of those in need.

Together, We Rise This is not just a call to action; it is a call to the heart. By standing together, we send a powerful message that we will not remain silent in the face of injustice. Let us continue to stand until justice prevails, and every individual is treated with the respect they deserve.

Join us, bring your compassion, and be a part of a movement that believes in the power of unity and love. Together, we can create a brighter, more just future for all.

With hope and determination,

The Handmaids of Las Vegas</p>

<h3>Stand Up Saturday: Theme TBD</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 7, 2026 at 7:00 PM UTC - 9:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>On the Charleston sidewalk in front of Baja Fresh<br>8780 W Charleston Blvd<br>Las Vegas, NV 89117</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Las Vegas</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>This week, we’ll continue to stand up with Minnesota. The state has been invaded by a rogue Federal government. They are unleashing chaos and violence on the streets, intensified by the murder of Renee Good. 
Minnesotans have continued to stand tall and peacefully protest and push back against this tyranny. A judge has ruled that ICE must discontinue its illegal and unconstitutional actions against protestors, but that’s unlikely to stop them. 

We must continue to stay loud and let our local elected leaders know that they have the power to create state actions to protect us from ICE. United acts of peaceful noncooperation are the only way we can topple fascism. 

Join us in solidarity. (And bring a friend!)

**Meet us on the Charleston sidewalk in front of Baja Fresh with your best signs.** 

We&apos;ll have music, free water, and extra signs. 

**Please park in the main parking lot at Boca Park.** 

RSVPing is not required but appreciated.

A core principle behind all Indivisible Las Vegas events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values and to act lawfully at these events. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events.

Protestors must also abide by Metro rules regarding protesting.</p>

<h3>Spokane SURJ Circle</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Sunday, February 1, 2026 at 11:00 PM UTC - 1:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Spokane Liberty Park Library<br>402 S Pittsburg St<br>Spokane, WA 99202</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Showing Up for Racial Justice</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Join our local SURJ Circle! 

Our emotions are intense, and our fear is real. It’s hard to know where to turn or what to do next when everything feels so uncertain. Renee Good and Alex Pretti should be alive today.  ICE is out of control in Minnesota– and organizers on the ground there are calling for national solidarity. No single action, no single leader will stop the dismantling of democracy or end the violence and fear unleashed by ICE. It&apos;s people standing together taking sustained, collective action over time that makes a difference.

In moments like this, when the harm feels overwhelming, we must reach out, get connected and grow our power to build the world we want—not for billionaires—but for regular people. We want good health care for everyone, affordable homes and safe neighborhoods.

Come attend a local meeting to get grounded with others, get clear on how we got here – and get organized to protect our immigrant neighbors and stop Trump&apos;s agenda.

Showing Up for Racial Justice (SURJ) is the largest organization in the US that explicitly organizes white communities for racial and economic justice-- because white people have a responsibility to step up and make sure our communities take a stand. Sign up to join us in the fight!</p>

<h3>ICE Protest Cathedral City</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Sunday, February 1, 2026 at 6:00 PM UTC - 7:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Outside Arco/AMPM<br>67625 E. Palm Canyon Dr.<br>Cathedral City, CA 92234</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> ResistTrump Campaign</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Join our regular #CoachellaResists Sunday action to protest ICE abuses and all the authoritarian actions of the Trump administration. ICE Out for Good!

Coachella Valley Arco/AMPM locations are owned by [local millionaire Trump megadonor Nachhattar Chandi](https://capitalandmain.com/trumps-california-henchmen-golden-state-business-enablers-0531). 

Every Sunday, we demonstrate outside Arco/AMPM and encourage people to boycott -- walk, bike, take the bus, carpool, drive an EV, or drive less, or go to another station, but let&apos;s show pro-Trump corporations that supporting oppression and secret police is not profitable! 

**This week, let&apos;s meet afterward to discuss future actions and how we can organize lawfully and nonviolently in Coachella Valley. Meeting place will be sent after signups.** 

See you Sunday! 

--------------------------------------------------------------

Nonviolent civil resistance has worked against dictators and authoritarian regimes - it worked for Gandhi, MLK, the Serbian democracy activists of the 1990s, and others. (https://www.nonviolent-conflict.org/about/civil-resistance/)

Our new volunteer group #CoachellaResists, is part of the #ResistTrump Campaign.

#ResistTrump&apos;s vision is a world without Trump and his enablers in power -- and the campaign aims to achieve that via lawful, nonviolent civil resistance. Its values are Collaboration, Integrity, Nonpartisanship, and Professionalism.

At Sunday&apos;s protest, we&apos;ll talk about further productive action.

See you there!</p>

<h3>ICE Out of Escondido Rally</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 28, 2026 at 6:00 PM UTC - 8:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Ash&amp; East Valley Parkway<br>E Valley Pkwy<br>Escondido, CA 92027</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> We The People - Troubled Nation</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Saturday, February 28, 2026
10:00 AM – 12:00 PM
Ash &amp; East Valley Parkway, Escondido

On February 28, our community in Escondido will join people across the country in demanding that businesses and public places take responsibility for what is happening on their premises. We will gather on East Valley Parkway to honor Carlos Roberto Montoya, who was killed during an ICE raid at a commercial location in Southern California, and to stand with all those who have been detained, terrorized, or abducted in and around businesses and public spaces nationwide.
This day of action is our chance to make our voices heard.

Tell Escondido: ICE Out!
Across the United States, ICE agents have been targeting immigrants in and around businesses and public places—stalking parking lots, confronting day laborers, and instilling fear in workers, customers, and surrounding neighborhoods. These raids are chaotic, violent, and too often deadly. In August, in Monrovia near Los Angeles, Carlos Roberto Montoya, a day laborer from Guatemala, lost his life while fleeing an ICE raid. He ran toward the freeway in fear and was struck by a car.

These tragedies are happening on the watch of businesses and public institutions.
On their property.
With their silence.

Too many Escondido businesses have not condemned these raids, have not demanded that the Administration stop targeting people on their premises, and have not taken meaningful steps to protect the workers and community members who rely on these spaces. By refusing to speak out or intervene, they allow their properties to become hunting grounds that feed arrest quotas, private detention centers, and the spread of fear in immigrant communities.

We demand that Escondido businesses and public institutions immediately:
1.	Publicly condemn ICE raids on their property
2.	Prohibit federal immigration enforcement from using their parking lots or public areas to target day laborers or community members
3.	Commit to creating safe, welcoming spaces for all people regardless of status

If anyone is unsafe in these spaces, then we are all unsafe. If businesses and public institutions stay silent, they will be complicit—and they will face not only moral shame, but the loss of trust and support across the U.S. and beyond.

On February 28, Escondido will stand up and say no more.
Join us. Bring your voice, your presence, and your solidarity.
Together we can demand accountability, dignity, and safety for all.

¡ICE Fuera de Escondido – Manifestación Comunitaria!
Sábado, 28 de febrero de 2026
10:00 AM – 12:00 PM
East Valley Parkway, Escondido

El 28 de febrero, nuestra comunidad en Escondido se unirá a personas de todo el país para exigir que los negocios y los espacios públicos asuman responsabilidad por lo que está ocurriendo en sus instalaciones. Nos reuniremos en East Valley Parkway para honrar a Carlos Roberto Montoya, quien murió durante una redada de ICE en un lugar comercial del sur de California, y para solidarizarnos con todas las personas que han sido detenidas, aterrorizadas o secuestradas en negocios y espacios públicos en todo el país.
Este día de acción es nuestra oportunidad para alzar la voz.

¡Escondido dice: ICE Fuera!
En todo Estados Unidos, agentes de ICE han estado atacando a inmigrantes en negocios y espacios públicos—acechando estacionamientos, confrontando a jornaleros e infundiendo miedo en trabajadores, clientes y vecindarios enteros. Estas redadas son caóticas, violentas y con demasiada frecuencia mortales. En agosto, en Monrovia, cerca de Los Ángeles, Carlos Roberto Montoya, un jornalero de Guatemala, perdió la vida mientras huía de una redada de ICE. Corrió hacia la autopista por miedo y fue atropellado por un automóvil.
Estas tragedias están ocurriendo bajo la mirada de negocios e 

instituciones públicas.
En sus propiedades.
Con su silencio.

Demasiados negocios en Escondido no han condenado estas redadas, no han exigido que la Administración deje de atacar a personas en sus instalaciones y no han tomado medidas significativas para proteger a los trabajadores y miembros de la comunidad que dependen de estos espacios. Al negarse a hablar o intervenir, permiten que sus propiedades se conviertan en terrenos de cacería que alimentan cuotas de arrestos, centros de detención privados y la propagación del miedo en las comunidades inmigrantes.

Exigimos que los negocios e instituciones públicas de Escondido:
1.	Condenen públicamente las redadas de ICE en sus propiedades
2.	Prohíban que agentes de inmigración utilicen sus estacionamientos o áreas públicas para atacar a jornaleros o miembros de la comunidad
3.	Se comprometan a crear espacios seguros y acogedores para todas las personas, sin importar su estatus migratorio
Si alguien no está seguro en estos espacios, entonces nadie lo está. Si los negocios y las instituciones públicas permanecen en silencio, serán cómplices—y enfrentarán no solo vergüenza moral, sino también la pérdida de confianza y apoyo en todo el país.

El 28 de febrero, Escondido se levantará para decir basta ya.
Acompáñanos. Trae tu voz, tu presencia y tu solidaridad.
Juntas y juntos podemos exigir responsabilidad, dignidad y seguridad para todas las personas.</p>

<h3>[Corona, CA] Standing up for Truth &amp; Freedom #ICEOutOfEverywhere</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, January 31, 2026 at 6:00 PM UTC - 10:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Rimpau Park<br>1151 E Ontario Ave<br>Corona, CA 92881</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> May Day Strong</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Circle City Solidarity is drastically increasing its visibility events over the coming weeks and months leading up to May 1st.  These events will act as our voice and ur ability to connect with one another for May Day and the goals we will accomplish moving forward.

In the past month two community volunteers were executed on Minneapolis streets. This regime has shown its true colors - and yet Trump&apos;s corporate backers continue to support him, refusing to take a stand with our communities and frequently directly supporting ICE. We are standing up to stop this regime of terror. **Stand with us and take action to demand an end to the occupation of Minnesota and demand corporations take a stand against ICE.** 

We’re focusing on corporate targets - companies set to benefit most from the occupation of ICE or who have particular ties to Minnesota - but any high visibility location will work. **This week our focus is Target** but we also encourage actions at Enterprise, Hilton, Home Depot, and Delta.

We know DHS Secretary Kristi Noem’s untrained ICE militia in our cities are about billionaires making themselves richer no matter the human cost. **We stand united demanding the removal of reckless untrained ICE agents from our communities and that ICE is abolished.** And we&apos;re taking our fight to the companies that are backing this administration and benefiting most.

**Together we will hit these companies in their pocketbooks, force the administration to end the occupation of our cities and spread the word to our neighbors that we deserve better.**

Every dollar spent terrorizing our communities is a dollar that could and should go to helping our communities thrive. We can have good jobs, better schools, access to healthcare and get our basic needs met. But not while our government works for billionaires and not for us.

Join us, stand strong and speak up.

*Please note: A core principle behind all our events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events*</p>

<h3>Feet on the Streets - with a twist - tell Home Depot to get I C E out</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Friday, January 30, 2026 at 5:00 PM UTC - 1:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Home Depot near Costco<br>725 Plaza Ct<br>Chula Vista, CA 91910</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>*A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*

Hi Everyone:

I&apos;m trying to think out of the box for ways to utilize Indivisible to organize a lot of Good Trouble ... 

You might have all heard about the badass warriors who made a point of all going to Home Depot to purchase an *ice scraper* with a CREDIT CARD if you can ... and then standing back in line 5 minutes later to return it ... (google it - people are so creative) .

***NEW IDEA***. Same thing, but buy a few screws with your credit card (it adds fees for HD) ... then when you return it a few minutes later, tell the employee to SCREW ICE ... make sure they know the reason you are returning !!!!

Well, how about we all just do that at our own leisure? 

I tried it last week - it was a success, and it made me feel better LOL ...

Here is what you can do ... as often as you can manage it ... work it into your routines if you have to!   I plan on doing it after my protests - on the way home !  

Go to Home Depot ... walk around and &quot;shop&quot; for as long as you want -- I like to go and just PAY ATTENTION -- I now know exactly what they look like from the hotel protests - I hear they like to cosplay as construction workers to fit in!  (they still stick out like a sore thumb in my book).  Have a WHISTLE ready to warn people if you see anything sus .......

Buy California&apos;s version of an &quot;ice scraper &quot;   I bought a small putty knife for 98 cents ...   ***NEW IDEA ... buy a few screws and return them saying SCREW ICE!!!***

PAY by your CREDIT CARD if you can - for extra bonus points (they get charged a fee no matter what is purchased with a credit card -- win win) ...

Then, immediately walk right back in the store and go to the Customer Service line to RETURN it !

I told the nice lady (remember it is NOT the employees fault their employers are not-c&apos;s ...kindness matters), that I was returning this &quot;ice scraper&quot; in solidarity with my friends in the community - to send a message that we do not welcome thugs into our neighborhoods to terrorize our friends!    All with a smile on my face ... she almost cried when she said, I totally understand !!   and happily returned my buck back to my credit card ...

ANYONE can make this happen -- if you are looking for a way to RESIST with us, but being on a street corner is intimidating (no judgment, we all do what we feel comfy with), well THIS little Good Trouble Causing mission is for you!!!

Bonus points if you then post about it on your social media platforms to encourage others to do this simple act!

They shut down a Home Depot (upper Cali) when they had 100&apos;s of people doing this AT THE SAME TIME ...

So, for now, let&apos;s just do it on our own ... whenever you can!

*Next up:  an actual protest in front of that same Home Depot - maybe we can coordinate it to do the ice scraper thing first, and then protest them afterward ... either on the main road, or right in front of their store ...........*

Beeeeeeep

<h3>ICE Out Now Sign Waving Rally--Claremont/Inland Valley</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, January 31, 2026 at 10:00 PM UTC - 11:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Foothill Blvd and Indian Hill Blvd<br><br>Claremont, CA 91711</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>The events of last few weeks in MN have been horrifying. On 1/31, groups across the country are gathering to demand ICE Out of Everywhere, permanently!  

Join us at the intersection of Foothill Blvd. and Indian Hill Blvd. to show resistance to the ICE executions of Renee Nicole Good and Alex Jeffrey Pretti.

Bring your signs and energy to peacefully express your resistance. Join us to make our voices heard together and be sure to read your confirmation email for some additional important information.

Given some recent changes in the parking situation, it&apos;s important to call out the following information:

Time-limited parking is available in the lot on the northwest corner of the intersection (some handicap parking also available there) as well as on side streets.

Because the bank on the northeast corner is closed by 2 p.m., you may park there. You may also park in the lot for the Methodist Church at 211 W Foothill Blvd, Claremont. DO NOT park in the lot on the southeast corner of the intersection as you will risk being towed. Additionally, while we&apos;ve not had a problem with people parking in the northwest parking lot as long as they observe the time limits, do not park in smaller business lots along Foothill as that could be problematic. Side streets are a good option for this event.

*A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
<h3>ICE OUT OF SAN DIEGO</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Thursday, February 5, 2026 at 6:30 PM UTC - 8:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>880 Front St<br>San Diego, CA 92101</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> San Diego &amp; Imperial Counties Labor Council, AFL-CIO</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Across the country, families are feeling the consequences of federal overreach. From attacks on due process and civil liberties to efforts to silence the free press and limit public access to information, these actions threaten the foundation of our democracy.

Everyday people are paying the price while those in power play political games with our rights and freedoms. These are not just policy choices; they are moral decisions that test who we are as a nation and whether we will stand up for justice, truth, and accountability.

Democracy dies in the dark. Now is the time to raise our voices, defend our rights, and demand transparency and fairness from those who claim to lead in our name.

Join us every Thursday outside the Federal Building (880 Front Street, San Diego) to demand that Washington fund care — not chaos. Together, we can send a clear message:

Gather at 10:30am and speaking program begins at 11:00am

• Healthcare is a human right.

• Food is a human right.

• San Diego stands for care, not chaos and cruelty.

This is more than a protest! It’s a stand for dignity, justice, and the right of every family to live free from fear. Bring your friends, your signs, and your voice. Together, we can show that San Diego stands for community, not cages. For more information contact us at cipriano.vargas@sdcounty.ca.gov</p>

<h3>Find Your Furever Valentine: Pet Supply Drive and Adoption Event</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 14, 2026 at 7:00 PM UTC - 2:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Pet Supplies Plus<br>2845 Northtowne Ln<br>Reno, NV 89512</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Biggest Little Action Group</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Find your fur-ever valentine this Valentine’s Day at an adoption event and pet food drive, co-hosted by BLAG and 50501 NNV! Throughout the day from 11am-6pm stop by Pet Supplies Plus to meet some paw-sitively adorably fur babies in need of a loving home, or drop off pet supplies anytime that will be donated to local rescues in need. 
  -  Cat adoption from 11am-3pm, thanks to Feral at Heart Cat Rescue
  -  Dog adoption from 3pm-6pm, thanks to Boxers and Buddies Dog Rescue
  -  Reptile adoption from 3pm-6pm, thanks to MTNGEMZ Reptile Rescue

This event will also bring awareness to the fact that when ICE thugs savagely separate families, this includes pets. After community members are abducted from our streets or from their home, ICE thugs leave pets alone in the car or home, leave them to roam free, tie them to a pole outside, and in some cases beat or shoot pets. Shelters and rescues in cities invaded by ICE are overwhelmed, and animals that have been separated from their families are further traumatized or euthanized due to overcrowding. 

We will provide resources to attendees on how to plan for your pets’ safety in the event of a detainment, and provide information about becoming a foster so animals can stay together until their owners are released from detention. Our pets are our families, too. We hope to see you there!</p>

<h3>Help assemble whistle packets for community defense (Feb. 1)</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Sunday, February 1, 2026 at 10:15 PM UTC - 12:15 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Washoe County Library, Sierra View Branch<br>4001 S. Virginia St.<br>Reno, NV 89502</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Biggest Little Action Group</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>As part of our work building community defense against immigration raids, we assemble and distribute packets containing a whistle together with instructions for how to use it when you see ICE or Border Patrol, along with Know Your Rights cards.  

We distribute the whistle packets at community events in general. We also intend to distribute them to, and to make the ingredients for them available to, individual community groups who want to strengthen their own neighborhood or community ability to respond to immigration raids. For more information about the campaign to distribute whistles, see this recent KUNR interview:
[Reno Group Distributes Whistles to Help Residents Respond to Immigration Raids](https://www.kunr.org/local-stories/2025-11-17/reno-group-distributes-whistles-to-help-residents-respond-to-immigration-raids)

Assembling these are labor-intensive, but when we get together to do it, it&apos;s fun. 

Along the way, you will learn how to fold an 8-page zine -- which is just one step away from being able to make your own!*  Click for [more about our whistle campaign](https://renoactiongroup.com/whistles/)</p>

<h3>Tyranny Tuesday - Impeach! Homeland Secretary Kristi Noem🤡📱</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, February 3, 2026 at 8:00 PM UTC - 9:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Bruce R. Thompson Courthouse and Federal Building<br>400 S Virginia St.<br>Reno, NV 89501</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Northern Nevada</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Within hours of federal agents killing Alex Pretti in Minneapolis, the Trump regime fired up the spin machine. Kristi Noem — the MAGA hardliner Trump installed to run DHS — rushed to blame Pretti for his own death, falsely claiming he “brandished” a gun, wanted to “kill law enforcement,” and branding him a “domestic terrorist.” Same playbook as earlier this month after agents under her watch killed Renee Good. Lie fast, smear the victim, move on. 🚨🧢

Let’s be clear: the terror in America right now isn’t people exercising their First Amendment rights. It’s the masked, unidentified goon squads operating under DHS, CBP, and ICE — brutalizing communities as a matter of policy. Noem isn’t keeping anyone safe; she’s overseeing intimidation, racism, and lawlessness, then daring the public to swallow whatever story drops first. 👀🔥

🦺 PLEASE NOTE: INNV supports non-violent participation in civic events. By registering and attending this event, attendees take full responsibility for keeping themselves safe by following instructions from Marshals, staying within the boundaries of the event, and de-escalating situations if you are confronted.</p>

<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Biggest Little Action Group</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>While Rep. Amodei wines and dines as a special guest inside the El Dorado, his abdication of congressional duty is allowing our neighbors to be kidnapped and state violence to be perpetrated against communities across the U.S. by ICE thugs. 

In his latest press release, Amodei defended this violence by stating “local agitators and politicians who have encouraged the continued interference with immigration enforcement operations. They share equal responsibility for creating a warzone mentality on the ground.”

To Amodei we say: FUCK that. The blame is yours.

Bring your signs and your courage as we call out Amodei for the harm he&apos;s inflicting upon his constituents and all Americans. There shall be no peace for fascist capitulators.

Gather at the corner of 4th St and S Virginia. This event is nonviolent and non-vandalizing.</p>

<h3>Biggest Little Action Group February Planning Meetings</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Thursday, February 5, 2026 at 2:00 AM UTC - 3:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>First Congressional Church of Reno<br>627 Sunnyside Dr<br>Reno, NV 89503</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Biggest Little Action Group</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Join us to discuss alternatives to the usual protests. If you&apos;re tired of standing on sidewalks waving signs at cars, we plan and perform meaningful actions designed to encourage and strengthen each other in opposition to fascism.

Some actions we&apos;ve done this year include displaying portraits of the victims of ICE disappearances at the federal courthouse and at Reno&apos;s baseball stadium; creating and distributing Know Your Rights information to interstate passengers on Greyhound and Amtrak; calling for citizens to make public comment at the Board of Commissioners meeting to testify against the cooperation between ICE and the county jail; and organizing opposition to the local Republican congressman and his reluctance to hold a town hall. We&apos;re also the people responsible for displaying antifascist messages over I-80 during rush hour. Some of our individual members are involved in community defense networks like ICE Response and Court Accompaniment. We do as much as we can and welcome new ideas and new members all the time.

We are nonviolent and non-vandalizing. We work in support of democracy and the Constitution, and against the fascist actions of the Trump administration, its supporters, and its enablers. Everyone can play a role in this fight. Come and see if you like our style.</p>

<h3>Protest Every Monday in Brea</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, February 3, 2026 at 1:00 AM UTC - 2:30 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>The Busiest Intersection in Brea<br>Imperial Highway &amp; State College Boulevard<br>Brea, CA 92821</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>## Join INDIVISIBLE CA-45 in Brea for a high visibility **PEACEFUL protest**

### RAIN CANCELS - Rain on the windshield and on the road and dark of night is a dangerous combination at the busiest intersection in Brea.

#### We will rally on every corner of the intersection of Imperial Highway and State College Boulevard in Brea, CA 92821. During rush hour, many thousands of cars will be passing by.

Some new safety guidelines starting November 3rd:
1.	 Do not cross streets unless absolutely necessary.  Select a corner for the rally and stay there.  (This is for your safety, as when it is dark drivers cannot see you as well. All of our close-calls have been with people crossing the street.)
2.	Remain behind the tape placed along the curb.
3.	For your signs to be more easily seen and read – please use white posters with black or dark lettering. (The artwork is pretty, but more difficult to see in the dark!)
4.	Try to stay in well lit areas.  Wear light colored clothing.

### Protest for Democracy, the Rule Of Law, and **FREEDOM OF SPEECH**

## Protest against the brutality of ICE !!!

### Bring your signs

### Bring your flags.

## BRING YOUR COSTUME!

# Please be safe!

**DO NOT PARK anywhere in the shopping area on the southwest corner of Imperial and State College.** Southeast and Northeast corners are best.

This a local Indivisible event!
**A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to _DE-ESCALATE_ any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.**</p>

We are meeting at the corner of Francisquito Ave. and Baldwin Park Blvd. in Baldwin Park. We can occupy all four corners of the intersection, if enough people come. There is parking at all four corner businesses, but I recommend you park in the TARGET/ Food For Less Parking lot. If you arrive early, you can start or wait for others. Sometimes people arrive a little late, but they will arrive. Feel free to bring umbrellas, personal fans, spray bottles of water, pop-up tents, whatever you need to be safe. Also, bring a sweater. Wheelchair accessible. Bathroom at Jack in the Box, Food for less, Mc Donalds. If there is rain, we will cancel. 

This a local Indivisible event!


*A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*</p>

<h3>Whittier Indivisible Chapter Weekly Strategy Meeting</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Friday, February 6, 2026 at 3:30 AM UTC - 4:30 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Come one, come all! We are the Whittier Indivisible Chapter, and we meet weekly on Zoom to discuss, share, plan, and listen. We engage in local, in-person efforts in our community as well as national initiatives. The majority of our members are from surrounding cities in addition to Whittier, CA. 

This a local Indivisible event! We strictly abide by and follow Indivisible leadership and protocol, and do not tolerate any behavior that is disrespectful, discriminating, or hateful in any way. 

Whittier Indivisible is a Southern California-based grassroots group committed to defending democracy, resisting authoritarianism, and standing up for the dignity and rights of all people—documented or undocumented. Rooted in Whittier and welcoming to all from surrounding communities, we are proudly pro-immigrant and oppose ICE overreach, racism, and any policy that dehumanizes or divides. We believe all people—regardless of immigration status, race, gender, disability, faith, or identity—have inherent worth, value, and dignity, and are entitled to the rights guaranteed by the Constitution, including due process, free speech, and equal protection under the law. We advocate for social and economic justice, environmental protection, and individual freedoms, while standing firmly against fascism and authoritarianism in all forms. As a community, we practice gracious and respectful communication, and value inclusivity, accessibility, diversity, equity, honesty, kindness, and ambition in our organizing. We believe strong, compassionate local action can create a more just, democratic, and sustainable future for all.

*A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*

ICE amped up the attacks on our neighborhoods in NELA these past weeks. We are continuing with the pressure to stop these brutal attacks on our community and across the nation. 

These raids are a part of a broader pattern of unchecked violence, impunity, and abuse carried out by federal immigration enforcement agencies against members of our communities. We demand accountability for the killings and an end to ICE and CBP raids. We will not sit by while violence goes unanswered and our communities are terrorized.

We demand accountability, honor the lives lost, and will make visible the human cost of ICE’s actions.</p>

<h3>Whistlemania! LBC: Neighborhood Folding Event at Sports Basement</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Friday, February 27, 2026 at 1:30 AM UTC - 3:30 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Sports Basement Long Beach<br>2100 N Bellflower Blvd<br>Long Beach, CA 90815</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Long Beach Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>This event in the community space upstairs at Sports Basement, check with the front desk or follow signs to find us. 

Fold zines, make whistle packs with us, and learn about how to become more involved in the opposition.

We saw the reports of Chicago residents coming together with indignant spirit and whistles around their necks to care for their neighbors and KICK ICE OUT. Following that lead, our Whistlemania! LBC goal is to put 16,000 whistle packs into the hands of Long Beach residents during the next 3 months as a sign of dissent and solidarity.

YOU CAN HELP.

<h3>Whistlemania! LBC: Neighborhood Folding Event at Watch Me</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Friday, February 20, 2026 at 2:00 AM UTC - 4:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Watch Me! Sports Bar<br>6527 E Pacific Coast Hwy Unit B-2<br>Long Beach, CA 90803</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Long Beach Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Join us at Watch Me! Sports Bar to fold zines, make whistle packs with us, and learn about how to become more involved in the opposition. They are not charging us for the use of the space and have asked that we purchase drinks or food to help support them. 

We saw the reports of Chicago residents coming together with indignant spirit and whistles around their necks to care for their neighbors and KICK ICE OUT. Following that lead, our Whistlemania! LBC goal is to put 16,000 whistle packs into the hands of Long Beach residents during the next 3 months as a sign of dissent and solidarity.

<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>✊ Weekly Saturdays Actions — ALL OF IT. ANY OF.IT... We Ain’t Buying It + Solidarity Visibility Brigade. 

This Week WE ARE BACK TO  Sat JAN. 31sr.. Honoring A. Pretti, R. Good, Hands Off Venezuela, No ilegal wars, respect internarional law, - RELEASE ALL THE EPSTEIN FILES, cuz we ain&apos;t buying the story either.  ALL OF IT ...

Indivisible CA27 is mobilizing EVERY SATURDAY [and sometimes SUNDAYS] and on purpose.

We’re joining cities across the country to continue to protest against ICE, in solidarity with MN, Protest Home DEPORT, Spotify, all of them - all of it!  

We stand with the Venezuelan community for a Free Venezuela - with due process and congressional approval for a LEGAL, forceful, decisive stand.  NO ILEGAL WARS!!  A stand against The Tyrant Maduro Regime but not manipulated by the Trump Tyrant Regime either.   

RELEASE ALL THE EPSTEIN FILES, Affordability, Healthcare; All of it. 

We continue in support of the We Ain’t Buying It national blackout and extending it all thru 2026 — a coordinated action using economic power to push back against corporate and political systems that enable injustice.  Non-Violent pushback works.

Come and protest for all the reasons you may have.  No time to stay silent.

Learn more about the national initiative here:
🔗 https://weaintbuyingit.com/

We’ll gather for a non-violent visibility protest to amplify the message locally and demonstrate that Santa Clarita is awake, engaged, and unafraid to show up.

📅 Date: Every Saturday during 2026 and beyond...
⏰ Time: 10:30 AM – 1:00 PM
📍 Location: Necessary Trouble Corner

Corner of Valencia Blvd. &amp; McBean Parkway

Bring:  A COAT - its cold !! 

Signs (or borrow)

Water and comfort essentials

Your voice and your presence

This is a weekly response — showing the power of a community ready to act constantly when needed.

If you cannot attend in person, you can still make an impact by amplifying posts from the national campaign on social media and sharing coverage with your network.

Let’s remind corporations, elected officials, and the community:
our power goes far beyond the ballot — we control where we put our dollars, our attention, and our bodies.

See you on the corner.

A core principle behind all Indivisible and 50501 events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.

<h3>Training: Best Practices for Effective Activism</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Thursday, February 19, 2026 at 3:00 AM UTC - 5:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Torrance Municipal Airport - Zamperini Field<br>3301 Airport Dr<br>Torrance, CA 90505</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible South Bay LA</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>The Trump administration continues to trample the constitution and violate people&apos;s human rights.  Between foreign invasions, trade wars, and vilification of our allies, they are damaging America&apos;s place in the world.  And their use of ICE to attack innocent civilians is criminal and in support of an unabashed agenda of white supremacy and nativism.

The training will be about the most effective ways we can fight this as individuals, along with the power of working in groups and coalitions.  We&apos;ll discuss best practices for protests, rallies, and boycotts; best approaches to contacting elected representatives; and ways to make a difference in competitive elections.

This will be an interactive session, where we can talk together and practice effective tactics.  Please join us!</p>

<h3>ICE OUT Weekly Protest - Downtown Bellevue</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, January 31, 2026 at 7:00 PM UTC - 8:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Bellevue Way Northeast &amp; Northeast 4th Street<br>Bellevue, WA 98004</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Exercise your free speech - while you still have it. Join Indivisible Eastside members in their ongoing protest of the harmful administration&apos;s policies every Saturday.

Downtown Bellevue at the corner of Bellevue Way and NE 8th St. Do not block sidewalks or roads. No walk off parking at the Bellevue Square Mall.

Hosted by Indivisible Eastside

On Wednesday, January 7th, an American citizen was killed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Minneapolis, Minnesota. This killing is part of a broader pattern of unchecked violence, impunity, and abuse carried out by federal immigration enforcement agencies against members of our communities.

We must stand up and send the strong message of ICE OUT FOR GOOD until ICE is out for good.

A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action and no civil disobedience. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values, and to act lawfully at these events. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events.

<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Seattle Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Renee Good deserves justice and we won&apos;t stand silently while her murder is covered up. Join our protest in honor of Renee and in solidarity with immigrant communities across the United States. 

**Join us and help send a clear message to Musk and Trump: We&apos;re not backing down. We&apos;re DOUBLING DOWN!**

Our protests have helped force Musk from DC but our work is far from done. **Tesla&apos;s stock is UP because investors think we&apos;re going to fade away** while Musk buys our elections, spews hate and lies on his social network, and bullies even conservative members of Congress into giving Trump the power of a KING.

The stakes couldn’t be higher. No one is coming to save us. Not politicians, not the media, not the courts. **Our democracy has never faced someone with so much money and so little shame as Elon Musk.**

Please, join us. We need your voice. Let&apos;s make some noise!

See you Saturday! 

Tesla Takedown is a peaceful protest movement. We oppose violence, vandalism and destruction of property. Please treat Tesla drivers with respect as they are most likely on our side!

<h3>Time to Act 2026!</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Sunday, February 1, 2026 at 8:00 PM UTC - 9:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Swing Left</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>It’s 2026—and Democracy is on the line. Will you step up and take action to help preserve our hard-won democratic norms freedoms, before they are crippled beyond repair?

You’ve seen the immense damage that Trump and MAGA have already done. They followed Project 2025 very closely (despite Trump disavowing it before the 2024 election), and now they want more. Venezuela. Greenland. ICE shootings in Minneapolis, Portland, and ______(?). Attacking opponents left and right. It’s downright scary.

And there’s more on the agenda… including possibly trying to cancel or invalidate the 2026 election.

**Not. On. Our. Watch.**

2026 is also the year we **Fight Back,** and we NEED YOUR HELP. Please join us for an upcoming Time to Act training with Seattle Supports Democracy/Swing Left Seattle.

In this one-hour Zoom session, we’ll teach you how to:

   -Take effective action to protect democracy (at whatever level you choose, from calling your reps and writing letters to direct action in the streets, and more).
    -Counter the anti-immigration agenda of the Trump administration and protect our friends and neighbors with different types of strategies.
    -Help register voters, turn them out to vote, and preserve free and fair elections for all.

We believe in taking positive action joyful (we find it&apos;s the best antidote for despair). We’ll help you identify the values and issues that are motivating you to speak out, then give you the skills and strategic knowledge to do it.

Past attendee Lisa F. said, &quot;This was an excellent training--organized, clear, and positive. I left inspired, and with a specific idea of the actions I wanted to take.&quot;

At Seattle Supports Democracy, we&apos;ve trained thousands of individuals over the last five years, activating them and helping them write letters, send texts, make calls, help others, and show up to defend our democratic freedoms and make their voices heard. Join the movement!</p>

<h3>Protest ICE Kidnappings for our Neighbors</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Friday, February 6, 2026 at 5:00 PM UTC - 6:30 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>12500 Tukwila International Blvd<br>Tukwila, WA 98168</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Southend Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Join Southend Indivisible and our partners Friday morning (and every Friday rain or shine) 9 am - 10:30 am on the sidewalk outside of ICE HQ in Tukwila to demand Trump&apos;s Gestapo stop the kidnappings of our neighbors, separation of families, and terrorizing of our community.

A core tenet of Southend Indivisible is peaceful, non-violent resistance and we will abide by this at all rallies and protests we host or co-host.

Bring your eye-popping, powerful signs. Not required though - we will have extra signs and materials for making them if you wish to make one on the spot.

Join us to tell Trump&apos;s goons HANDS OFF OUR COMMUNITY!</p>

<h3>JUSTICE FOR GOOD. ABOLISH ICE: Lynnwood</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, January 31, 2026 at 8:00 PM UTC - 10:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Tesla Lynnwood<br>17731 Pacific Hwy<br>Lynnwood, WA 98037</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Seattle Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Renee Good deserves justice and we won&apos;t stand silently while her murder is covered up. Join our protest in honor of Renee and in solidarity with immigrant communities across the United States. 

**Trump&apos;s devastating cuts to Medicare and other critical programs so he can give massive tax breaks to billionaires are unconscionable.**Join us in protesting the attack on our rights, the plundering of our country, **and the billionaire who made it all possible.**

Our protests have helped force Musk from DC but our work is far from done. Tesla&apos;s stock is UP because investors think we&apos;re going to fade away. That&apos;s not going to happen.

**Without Musk&apos;s backing, Trump wouldn&apos;t be president and we wouldn&apos;t have to fear for the future of our country. Our democracy has never faced someone with so much money and so little shame as Elon Musk and he&apos;ll remain a danger until we take Tesla&apos;s stock to single digits.**

Please, join us. We need your voice. Let&apos;s make some noise!

See you Saturday!

        <name>Washington for All: Sign up for ICE Mobilization Alerts</name>
        <description><![CDATA[
<h3>Washington for All: Sign up for ICE Mobilization Alerts</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Wednesday, October 29, 2025 at 7:00 AM UTC - 8:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Washington Indivisible Network</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>## **Washington is home. We belong here.**

Working people build Washington. Whether we&apos;re picking apples in the Yakima Valley, fishing on the coast, milling lumber in Aberdeen, raising a family in Tacoma, or running small businesses in Seattle, we&apos;ve earned the right to feel safe and respected in the place we call home.

But, just like in LA &amp; Chicago, the Trump Administration has promised to keep terrorizing cities across America via increased ICE tactical units, mass raids, and deploying the National Guard,  including right here in Washington State. They want us to believe some of us don’t belong here by spreading hate and division. But who really doesn’t belong on our streets? Masked agents who are tearing apart our communities through violence instead of safety.

Trump and his billionaire backers don’t get to decide who belongs in our state. We do.

We are preparing for a variety of scenarios across our state in the event that they escalate their efforts to turn our government into a weapon against our people.

Sign up to know when it’s time for Washingtonians to come together to protect one another.

**We are standing with one purpose**: Together, we will train, organize, and communicate our shared commitment to a free and safe Washington for all.

In preparation, together we will: 

* Train on de-escalation and strategic non-cooperation   
* Make and distribute whistle kits for community defense   
* Distribute information so businesses and individuals know their legal rights

When it&apos;s time to mobilize, we will: 

* Mobilize a unified response
* Advocate for real solutions that meet our needs - like fully-funding our schools, creating good jobs and making healthcare affordable - not wasting our time and money to harass our neighbors
* Focus attention on the ICE violating our rights

### **SIGN UP FOR MOBILIZATION ALERTS &amp; SPREAD THE WORD**

### **We need all hands on deck. Washington thrives when all of us can live without fear, and our success does not come at the expense of others. This is our shared fight.**

A core value of Washington for All is a commitment to nonviolent action.</p>

<h3>In-Person Lunchtime Meeting w/ Sen. Cantwell&apos;s Staff</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Wednesday, September 9, 2026 at 8:00 PM UTC - 8:45 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Federal Office Building<br><br>Seattle, WA 98104</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Seattle Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p># Join Seattle Indivisible for a Critical Discussion with Senator Cantwell&apos;s Staff

Join Seattle Indivisible for an engaging Zoom discussion and Q&amp;A session with staff from Senator Maria Cantwell&apos;s office. As we navigate a complex political landscape in 2025, several key issues demand our attention:

Key Issues in 2026
🧊 Paramilitary Forces Attacking Immigrants and our Cities
ICE and CPB waging illegal, violent campaigns against immigrants and Black and brown people. 


🏛️ Constitutional Concerns
The ongoing failure of institutions to protect our rights and programs established by Congress have raised serious questions about the erosion of democratic principles.

💰 Economic Uncertainty
The imposition of a federal spending freeze has led to confusion and legal challenges, impacting various programs and contributing to fiscal instability.

⚖️ Social Equity
Policies targeting marginalized communities, including restrictions on transgender rights and potential cuts to social safety nets, underscore the ongoing struggle for social justice.

Senator Cantwell has been a vocal advocate for protecting democratic institutions, promoting economic stability, and advancing social equity. This session offers a unique opportunity to engage directly with her staff on these pressing issues.

📢 Your participation is crucial in voicing concerns and influencing decisions that impact our community.

We look forward to your active involvement in shaping the future of our state and nation!</p>

If you don’t live in Federal Way, WA, you can substitute your local officials in the “to” box.</p>

<h3>ICE OUT! Justice for Pretti and Good: Tacoma</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, January 31, 2026 at 6:00 PM UTC - 8:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Union Station - Federal Courthouse<br>1717 Pacific Ave<br>Tacoma, WA 98402</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Seattle Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>**Alex Pretti and Renee Good deserve justice and we won&apos;t stand silently while their murders are covered up.** 

Join our protest in honor of Alex and Renee and in solidarity with immigrant communities across the United States. 

**WE CALL FOR JUSTICE FOR ICE VICTIMS AS WE FIGHT TO PROTECT OUR DEMOCRACY FROM TRUMP AND HIS OLIGARCHS.**

Our protests have helped force Musk from DC, but our work is far from done. **Tesla&apos;s stock is UP because investors think we&apos;re going to fade away** while Musk continues to spread lies and hate across the globe. 

He&apos;s been quieter lately but with midterms coming up, there&apos;s no doubt that Elon will side with the rich and powerful over the rest of us. 

The stakes couldn’t be higher. No one is coming to save us. Not politicians, not the media, not the courts. **Our democracy has never faced someone with so much money and so little shame as Elon Musk.**

Please, join us. We need your voice. Let&apos;s make some noise!

See you Saturday! 

Tesla Takedown is a peaceful protest movement. We oppose violence, vandalism and destruction of property. Please treat Tesla drivers with respect as they are most likely on our side!</p>

ICE IS TERRORIZING OUR CITIES. An estimated 70,000 people have been detained and American citizens are being shot in the streets. 

Join us in solidarity with Minnesota, and our own Oregon communities to demand accountability, honor the lives lost, and make visible the human cost of ICE’s actions. 

Bring your signs, bring a friend, and meet fellow resistors. Stand up and Defend Democracy! Support our East County Immigrant Community.

When we show up, we inspire others to do the same, because 
COURAGE is CONTAGIOUS!

A core principle behind all ICE Out For Good events is a commitment to nonviolent action and no civil disobedience. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values, and to act lawfully at these events. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events.</p>

Parking is free in the city lot on Washington Ave. starting at 5 p.m. There are additional free and paid lots throughout downtown as well as some street parking. Be sure to read signage wherever you park.

If no designated parking is available, as long as your car is displaying handicap plates or a plaque, you may park as long as needed in a regular space. 

To help create a unified and respectful presence, please consider bringing an electric candle, wearing black, or carrying a sign honoring Renee Nicole Good and Alex Jeffrey Pretti.

All are invited to stand in solidarity, reflect, and hold space for their memory.

* Potluck Finger Foods for Snacks for 10 - 12 people. 
We tend to have an abundance


FEB 17 AGENDA To Be announced

Speaker first half
Groups second half

Bring a finger food snack to share -
Our potluck was a generous success last time AND we had an over abundance of food. We can figure this out - maybe bring for a dozen people?

It&apos;s time to get organized in interest groups to handle everything being thrown at us.

The goal for a group will be to keep the larger group up to date on the action steps - how they can participate as needs arise in urgency. YES protests are still happening, yet there is so much more we need to do!

Which one or two of these topics are you passionate about?
Consider picking one to stay informed and join with others.

There will be an opportunity at the meeting to meet together and make plans.

✴️ The following Groups would love for you to join them 

Each topic is an umbrella topic, meaning there are many actions that need attention in each group. Join a group, speak up and get your idea supported. Bring your research, ask questions, find out how you can get involved at your comfort level. 

1.  Neighbor to neighbor food drives
Helpline/KIAC Food donations picked up in neighborhoods. This offers an opportunity to get your neighbors involved and informed of ways they can help.

2. Political &quot;Next Steps&quot; and how to make a difference! 
Key and important for the way ahead. There are many topics under this umbrella. 
Candidates | postcard-ing | Voting Registration | Issues | Office Visits 
Want to lead a voter drive?  Get organized here

3. Protest and Event Planning - 
Regular weekly protests | Bannering | Burma Shave silent walks
The group has an idea for a Peace Concert - Volunteer to help!
Join protests up and down the peninsula in Kitsap County
⭐Next big National event going for the 3.5% is in March sometime 

4. Health
Health &amp; Safety for LBGQTA  &amp; DEIA
Health issues are being attacked. Lives are at stake
General insurance rate increases are affecting many

5. Informal drop in Coffee group Fridays at Carter&apos;s on Bay street 10 am - 
     Yes we plan to be there this Friday! It&apos;s drop in - come if you can. 

6. Weekly Protests: Honk &amp; Wave groups! Yes they are doing it in the RAIN! Bring your signs and make some noise!
Mondays in Belfair 3-4:30 p.m. Corner across from Safeway NE State Route 3
Wednesdays at the Port Orchard City Hall 12 - 2

These groups still need to get organized -
Let me know if you will research info and get it to the larger group! 
* Rapid Responders - Training and teams
* Whistle Organizers - 
* Resistance - Pramila Jayapal next steps for Immigrants
* Post Card Writing Group
* Resilience - Self care group  
* Protest Planning &amp; Bannering
* ICE and Detention updates 
* Know your rights education
* Admin Support - Website, Social Media, Resource page, New member follow up, Data keeping, phone calls, partnering, 

What topics have I missed? What part do you want to play? Dividing it up gets so much more accomplished and makes a HUGE difference. You are not alone!

YES! Bring your non perishable food donations for Helpline and KIAC to the meeting. A volunteer will get them to the proper location. 
KIAC.org has specific food &amp; household requests -Maseca, dried black beans, white rice, vegetable oil, toilet paper, paper towels, shampoo, dish soap, laundry soap, toothpaste.</p>

<h3>Screw ICE! Lets get ICE out of Home Depot.</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, January 31, 2026 at 10:00 PM UTC - 12:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>The Home Depot<br>10120 SE Washington St<br>Portland, OR 97216</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Outer East Portland Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>*Outside the Home Depot where our neighbors gather to seek an honest day’s work, we will hold signs and flags for those who&apos;ve been taken, abused, and killed by ICE. Every worker’s life matters, and together we demand justice for all.*

### Join us for a honk and wave visibility event at the Mall 205 Home Depot as part of the national Disappeared In America campaign. ###

#### We&apos;re showing up all, across the country to speak out against the collaboration between corporations and ICE that has led to the detention, abuse, and deaths of immigrant workers. In a series of strategic actions - organzing, flyering, and buy-ins, everyday shoppers can engage in this defiance. ####

These “ICE Out of Home Depot” actions honor workers like Carlos Roberto Montoya, who lost his life while fleeing an ICE raid in Monrovia, California, and countless others who have faced harassment, racial profiling, and violence simply for seeking honest work. 

#### We call on Home Depot and other corporations to stop enabling policies that endanger immigrant workers and tear families apart communities will stand together in peaceful but firm resistance, demanding safety, solidarity and justice for all who labor.

Indivisibles are committed to non-violence as a guiding principle in everything we do. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values</p>

<h3>Indivisible PDX D3 February General Meeting</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Thursday, February 5, 2026 at 3:00 AM UTC - 5:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Montavilla United Methodist Church<br>232 SE 80th Ave<br>Portland, OR 97215</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible PDX D3</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Attend the monthly general meeting for Indivisible Portland District 3 (PDX D3)!

We will have special guest speakers: Two local activists will tell the story of witnessing an ICE abduction out in the community. They will share how they used their Migra Watch training and knowledge of local resources to jump into action on site. Following their shared experience of this horrific event event, these two community members stayed in contact with the hopes of building a supportive bridge between their communities, which has given rise to a new mutual aid project they will discuss. They will also share some practical details they learned at the incident, which they think would be helpful to know for anyone finding themselves in a similar situation in the future.

Join us to connect with other locals who are concerned about the state of American democracy and learn about ways to get involved in upcoming protests, trainings, action campaigns, and community building events.

A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.</p>

<h3>Good Trouble Saturday - Get the ICE Out!</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, January 31, 2026 at 8:00 PM UTC - 9:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>3500 E 4th Plain Blvd<br>Vancouver, WA 98661</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Greater Vancouver</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>✊ GOOD TROUBLE SATURDAYS ✊
Join Indivisible Greater Vancouver (IGV) and MoveOn–Clark County
We’re turning up the volume on justice every Saturday — standing together in solidarity with our neighbors and against the rising tide of ICE-fueled intimidation in our community.
Inspired by civil rights icon John Lewis, our weekly rallies are now Good Trouble Rallies — peaceful, non-violent actions rooted in love, courage, and the belief that we keep each other safe. We show up because our community deserves to live free from fear, harassment, and authoritarian overreach.
Location:
📍 E Fourth Plain Blvd &amp; Wilson Ave
On the south side of Evergreen Park and in the heart of Vancouver’s vibrant Latin community — and an area where we’ve seen an alarming increase in ICE presence and unjust detentions. We show up to say: Not on our watch.
🕓 Saturdays, 12–1 PM
🪧 Bring:
Your signs, your noisemakers, and your voice.
Some parking is available at Evergreen Park or in the surrounding neighborhood.
🗣️ Let’s send a clear message:
We protect each other. We stand with our immigrant neighbors. We reject authoritarianism in all forms.
Join us in making some Good Trouble — because our community deserves safety, dignity, and a government that works for the people, not one that terrorizes them.</p>

<h3>Call Sen Merkley - Vote NO! Demand Accountability &amp; Not One Penny More for ICE</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Thursday, January 29, 2026 at 8:00 AM UTC - 7:59 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Outer East Portland Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>*On Wednesday, January 7th, Renee Good, an American citizen, was shot and killed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Minneapolis, Minnesota. This killing is part of a broader pattern of unchecked violence, impunity, and abuse we&apos;re seeing in our own communities, carried out by federal immigration enforcement agencies against neighbors, co-workers, and friends.*

### Call Senator Merkley today. 
Join in the broad coalition of Americans across the country as we **call on Congress to get ICE Out For Good.** We can&apos;t wait around while ICE and DHS continue to harm more people. Congress MUST demand an **end to these reckless immigration raids, and  oppose any appropriations bill that includes increased funding for ICE or Border Patrol, and refuse to vote for any funding bill for DHS** 

### Congress must: 
- Strengthen restrictions on ICE and Border Patrol’s ability to conduct dragnet arrest operations and target people based on their race, language or accent, place of employment, or location at the time of the apprehension;
- End Border Patrol deployment to our cities and reject its ever-expanding mandate in immigration enforcement; and
- Limit DHS&apos;s reprogramming and transfer authority, including specifically preventing reprogramming and transferring funds for detention.


You can call every day - only once a day, though, to have your call counted.

#### Merkley DC office phone  (202) 224-3753
#### Portland office phone  (503) 326-3386
#### You may get a voicemail - Do leave a message 

**Here&apos;s a simplified message you can use as your call script**  
Hi, my name is [Your Name], and I’m a constituent from [Your City, State].

I’m calling to urge Senator Merkley to refuse to vote for any appropriations bill for the Department of Homeland Security that fails to rein in ICE.

Renee Good’s killing on January 7, is part of a broader pattern of unchecked violence, impunity, and abuse carried out by federal immigration enforcement agencies against our communities.

We can&apos;t wait around while ICE harms more people. Senator Wyden must push for an appropriations bill that puts serious restrictions on ICE, ends its dragnet raids, and doesn’t add a penny to its already bloated budget. 


##### If you&apos;re talking with a staffer, or if you&apos;d like - ask for a response. Make sure to leave your email too, to receive a response.

Do share this action with friends - maybe invite folks over for some coffee and calling.</p>

<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>This event provides seniors with an opportunity that they might not otherwise have to make themselves heard on issues of national importance. Many of us have mobility limitations and use wheelchairs, walkers, canes. The site was chosen for its accessibility and visibility. It is also a community-building event: we have had people from all over Portland and all ages participate. Everyone is welcome. We are committed to non-violent action and to making Good Trouble. 

Join us!

*A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*</p>

<h3>ICE Out - Solidarity with Minnesota Rally</h3>

<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Roseville Galleria<br>Roseville Parkway &amp; Galleria Boulevard<br>Roseville, CA 95678</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Roseville CA</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>ICE Out of Everywhere!

ICE agents are brutally beating and killing innocent people in the streets of Minneapolis and other American cities.  They are using escalating force, macing and tear gassing peaceful observers, detaining people including children, breaking into homes with no warrants and terrorizing entire communities.  Enough is enough!  When did America turn into a fascist state?  We will not normalize this violence and we refuse to stay silent!  

Our own Federal government has weaponized ICE against us and they are lying about what we see happening with our own eyes.  Bring your voice, signs, noisemakers, cowbells, whistles, music, etc. and join us as were rise up in protest!  We must not let this stand!  We demand accountability and justice for Nicole Good and Alex Pretti who were murdered in cold blood by cowardly ICE thugs.  

A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action and no civil disobedience. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values, and to act lawfully at these events. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events. All events should be held in public spaces or on public property.

<h3>Canby: Day Without an Immigrant</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Monday, February 16, 2026 at 8:00 PM UTC - 10:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>S Ivy St and 99E<br>Canby, OR 97013</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Join us for a sign waving event to show support for the vulnerable members of our community. Let them know they are not alone.

Location: along 99E between S Ivy St and S Grant St in Canby, OR.
Time: Monday, February 16th, 2026  from 12pm-2pm.
Parking available at Zoar Lutheran Church 190 SW 3rd Ave, Canby, OR 97013.

Endorsed by Bridging Cultures/Puentes Entre Culturas.

From PCUN (Oregon&apos;s Farmworker Union):
Immigrant workers are the backbone of Oregon&apos;s most important sectors. We came here following the American dream, and to build a better life for our families. We work the jobs nobody else will do. They are backbreaking, low-paid, and sometimes dangerous. We helped make this country the richest country in the world. We&apos;re not criminals, we&apos;re families, workers, PEOPLE!

We have seen an overwhelming increase in ICE and Border Patrol in our communities, terrorizing our children, destabilizing our local business, harming our community. We have something Trump and his cronies want, our labor, our money, our time.

No work. No shopping. No school. Join our cause!

Our goal is to get ICE Out of our barrios by building solidarity amongst allies and immigrant workers. We need other sectors to stand up against gestapo immigration enforcement, and find real solutions to our broken immigration system.

What Happens on a Day Without An Immigrant? We&apos;re asking YOU to take the day off of work, and NOT participate economically. A Day Without An Immigrant is for all sectors of the economy.

On February 16th, 2026 we want you to join Day Without An Immigrant in cities across the state. Thanks for your support!

This a local Indivisible event!

<h3>ICE OUT for Good</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, January 31, 2026 at 9:00 PM UTC - 10:30 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>5698 SW Canyon Ct<br>Portland, OR 97221</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Stand Up For the Truth</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Protest can feel pointless, tiresome and lonely, but it&apos;s a crucial step in building a community network that can withstand the regime&apos;s assaults.

ICE will disappear your neighbors and they will kill you. Then the regime will slander you and investigate your family. Minneapolis stood up and we can too. This revolting gang of fascists is playing for all the marbles.  Murder and kidnapping are just the beginning. The aim is subjugation and ICE is trump&apos;s own brown shirt army. It&apos;s time to stand up!

Join us most Saturdays from 1:00 to 2:30 or come at 12:30 to help set up. And bring a friend, a neighbor, your whole posse!</p>

<h3>Friday Function in the Junction</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Friday, January 30, 2026 at 11:30 PM UTC - 12:30 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Skyway &amp; Neal Road<br>Paradise, CA 95969</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>“Get in good trouble, necessary trouble, and help redeem the soul of America.” - John Lewis

During Friday Function in the Junction, bring American flags, if you have them. Wear bright colored clothing, bring your choice of resistance posters.

We will push the crosswalk button. After the first row of cars come to a complete stop, we will cross Skyway together inside the crosswalk. Then let cars go by, as we wait for our turn to again cross Skyway.

If you don’t feel comfortable walking, or just want to come out for support, feel free to bring a chair and enjoy the protest music.

To make car honking be your friend, bring a sign to encourage honking, such as:

“Honk for Peace”
“Honk in memory of Renee Good (or Alex Pretti)
“Honk to stop ICE
“Honk for Remaining Epstein Files

MAGA or not, these are our neighbors in a small community, so be kind. If drivers wish to argue, wish them a good evening.

*A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*</p>

<h3>No Ice, No Troops in Beaverton, Oregon</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Wednesday, February 4, 2026 at 11:30 PM UTC - 12:30 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>6125 SW Hall Blvd<br>Beaverton, OR 97008</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>We are getting an enthusiastic response, and people asked if we are going to do it again! So we are! ICE have been seen all over Washington County, including Beaverton, quite a bit in the past several weeks. We don’t want them here; all of our neighbors belong. And we do not need or want federal troops in Oregon. There is no invasion, no insurrection. We are peaceful protesters exercising our Constitutional right of free speech by saying no to ICE, no to federal troops including the National Guard. We are thanking our local law enforcement for doing their job and remembering that Oregon is a sanctuary state, where police are not cooperating with ICE. And we are peaceful. Bring your friends and neighbors and signs and chants, and music. Indivisible Beaverton is hosting this event. All are welcome.
  Please note time change as the days get darker to 3:30-4:30.

<h3>Demand McClintock Defend the Constitution - National Day of Lobbying</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, February 17, 2026 at 10:00 PM UTC - 11:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>McClintock&apos;s Modesto Office<br>1020 15th St<br>Modesto, CA 95354</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> 50501 California</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>It&apos;s been one heck of a year! We&apos;ve seen flagrant violations of the constitution by this administration, in many areas. This is not normal politics. This is not simply disagreements in how government should run. 

Let&apos;s join together and let McClintock know how we feel on this National Day of Lobbying. Our main messages are: impeach Trump, abolish ICE, defend the constitution. Other relevant topics include:
- repeated violations of the constitution by the Trump administration
- reckless abuse of power by DHS &amp; ICE, resulting in deaths of American citizens
- human rights violations in ICE detention facilities
- majority of ICE arrests have no criminal record
- our allies have been treated disrespectfully and have been turned into adversaries
- tariffs have not been effective &amp; a Times investigation shows 96% of tariff costs are paid by the US consumer
- failure to abide by the Epstein Transparency Act &amp; an apparent continued coverup of Epstein files
- healthcare costs
- violation of the emoluments clause with Trump&apos;s business dealings and doubling his personal wealth since taking office
- the US continued support of the genocide against the Palestinian people. We must stop funding, and providing weapons to Israel.

We will request to speak to McClintock&apos;s staff, most likely in small groups. You will have the opportunity to ask a question and share your concerns.</p>

<h3>Vigil for Alex Pretti - Elk Grove CA</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Monday, February 2, 2026 at 12:30 AM UTC - 2:30 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>In front of the Designer Shoe Warehouse (DSW)<br>Bruceville Road &amp; Laguna Boulevard<br>Elk Grove, CA 95758</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Elk Grove Laguna</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Join us this Sunday February 1st from 4:30 PM to 6:30 PM for a peaceful candlelight vigil (visibility event) as our community comes together to honor the life of Alex Pretti, who was murdered on Saturday January 24th by Trumps federal agents. Together we stand with Minneapolis, and reject the brutality carried out by federal immigration enforcement. Our outrage comes from a place of deep care for our neighbors, our families, and every person who deserves dignity and safety.  We will be in front of the Designer Shoe Warehouse (DSW) at the corner of Bruceville Road and Laguna Boulevard. 

We will hold candles, share space, and lift up the values that define us: compassion, solidarity, and the unwavering belief that every human life matters.

Bring a candle, a light, signs of solidarity, or simply your presence. 

“Statement from the family of Alex Pretti, Michael and Susan Pretti: We are heartbroken but also very angry. Alex was a kindhearted soul who cared deeply for his family and friends and also the American veterans whom he cared for as an ICU nurse at the Minneapolis VA hospital. Alex wanted to make a difference in this world. Unfortunately he will not be with us to see his impact. I do not throw around the hero term lightly. However his last thought and act was to protect a woman. The sickening lies told about our son by the administration are reprehensible and disgusting. Alex is clearly not holding a gun when attacked by Trump&apos;s murdering and cowardly ICE thugs. He has his phone in his right hand and his empty left hand is raised above his head while trying to protect the woman ICE just pushed down all while being pepper sprayed. Please get the truth out about our son. He was a good man. Thank you.”

A core principle behind all Indivisible Elk Grove - Laguna events is a commitment to nonviolent action and no civil disobedience. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values, and to act lawfully at these events. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events. All events should be held in public spaces or on public property.

Remind yourself of your rights as a protester here &gt;&gt; https://www.aclu.org/know-your-rights/protesters-rights Please bring signs or other props for attention.</p>

<h3>For Alex : ICE OUT FOR GOOD OAK PARK</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Sunday, February 1, 2026 at 8:00 PM UTC - 10:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>35th Street &amp; Broadway<br>Sacramento, CA 95817</p>

<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>ICE Out for Good — Oak Park Protest

Join us this Sunday, 12–2 PM, at 36th &amp; Broadway!

This is the moment.
This is the line in the sand.

Project 2025 is already giving ICE cover to act outside legal limits — escalating force, detaining people without cause, and terrorizing families in broad daylight. We refuse to normalize this. We refuse to stay silent. We show up to demand accountability, transparency, and safety for our communities.

Bring your voice.
Bring your signs.
Bring your courage.

See you at 36th &amp; Broadway — visible, loud, and united.</p>

<h3>Day Without an Immigrant</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Monday, February 16, 2026 at 7:00 PM UTC - 9:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> PCUN (Oregon&apos;s Farmworker Union)</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Join us on February 16th from 11am-1pm for our next Day Without an Immigrant visibility action! 

We will be doing a sidewalk march in front of our State Capitol in support of our immigrant neighbors. 

Immigrant workers are the backbone of Oregon&apos;s most important sectors. We came here following the American dream, and to build a better life for our families. We work the jobs nobody else will do. They are backbreaking, low-paid, and sometimes dangerous. We helped make this country wealthy.

We have seen an overwhelming increase in ICE and Border Patrol in our communities, terrorizing our children, destabilizing our local business, harming our community. We have something Trump and his cronies want, our labor, our money, our time. 

No work. No shopping. No school. Join our cause!
Our goal is to get ICE Out of our barrios by building solidarity amongst allies and immigrant workers. We need other sectors to stand up against gestapo immigration enforcement, and find real solutions to our broken immigration system. 

What Happens on a Day Without An Immigrant? We&apos;re asking YOU to take the day off of work, and NOT participate economically. A Day Without An Immigrant is for all sectors of the economy. On the days identified below we will send opportunities to join Day Without An Immigrant in cities across the state. Thanks for your support!</p>

<h3>ICE OUT of Everywhere National Day of Action Jan 30th</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Friday, January 30, 2026 at 10:00 PM UTC - 12:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Springfield City Hall<br>225 5th St<br>Springfield, OR 97477</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Eugene - Springfield</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>## Stand with Minnesota for a National Day of Action
### No Business as usual!

Somali students in Minneapolis have called for their Minnesota strike to be repeated on January 30th and have asked for organizations across the nation to endorse the strike to make it a nationwide strike. This is the way for the people to stop ICE’s reign of terror; we need to SHUT IT DOWN. 

Join us at the Springfield City Hall at 2 pm on Friday Jan 30th, where we will gather for a rally to say: 

#### *No business as usual while our communities are under attack! We are building the general strike, we will fight back!*

After the rally at City Hall we&apos;ll unite for a car caravan from Springfield to Eugene, and back again, to show just what our numbers can do when we commit to shutting it down together. Bring your signs, flags, energy and love for our immigrant neighbors.</p>

<h3>Letter to Mayor Kaarin Knudsen and Eugene City Council - State of Emergency</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Wednesday, January 21, 2026 at 8:00 AM UTC - 8:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Eugene - Springfield</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>### Oregon cities are writing to government officials to direct them to stand against federal immigration practices by declaring a state of emergency in Eugene over ICE enforcement that has raised intense fears. Let the state of Oregon stand in solidarity with it’s cities standing up to ICE and federal agents. 
_______________________________________________________________________________

Oregon cities are taking action as Federal agents have arrested or detained people without due process, refused to share reasons for arrests they make and questioned people about their immigration status based on race, ethnicity, accent or job, according to the declaration. And legitimate law enforcement officers do not wear masks. **Ever.**  

* **Raids target workplaces:** businesses in hospitality (restaurants, car washes, bakeries), construction, agriculture (farms, meatpacking, poultry), and retail (like Home Depot).                                                                                              
* **Educational Institutions**                                                                                                               
* **Healthcare &amp; Sensitive Locations:** Recent enforcement has included hospitals, schools, and places of worship, people in their cars and peaceful protesters.     
                                                                                                                                                        
Salem, Woodburn, Hillsborough, and Washington County are stepping up to protect the rights of the people. **“Our diversity is our strength, and we will never waiver from our commitment to serve every person who lives here with dignity.”**

Woodburn **residents and business owners** described downtown Woodburn as a &quot;ghost town&quot;  in the wake of the arrests. Officials estimated 50% to 80% fewer people were walking around the city&apos;s center.  “Keeping families together and children protected and safe is a fundamental value for Oregon cities.” 

ICE agents are arrested for alleged criminal acts like assault, violating civil rights through unlawful searches/seizures engaging in misconduct, or potentially committing crimes while on duty. 

We the undersigned, as Oregonians, and as Americans, hereby demand you add Eugene‘s declaration of a state of emergency ASAP to arrest ICE and federal agents that break the law, to the list of other Oregon cities. 

Respectfully and in Solidarity, 


The undersigned</p>

<h3>Rally for Minnesota</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Sunday, February 1, 2026 at 9:00 PM UTC - 11:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>North Broadway &amp; East Main Street<br>Santa Maria, CA 93454</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Santa Maria</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Customs and Border Patrol under Homeland Security has shot and killed another person in Minneapolis, in broad daylight, with video evidence capturing the incident. This was neither an accident nor an isolated event. No amount of finger-pointing or spin from Trump and the Republicans can change that. This is murder, just like we saw with Renee Good and the others who died this month due to ICE actions or while in custody.

Join Indivisible Santa Maria for a pop-up protest to honor Alex Pretti and support the cause for which he lost his life. Protest with us on Sunday, February 1st, at Broadway and Main from 1:00 to 3:00 pm. 

A core principle of all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to try to de-escalate any potential confrontations with those who disagree with our values.</p>

<h3>ICE Out of SLO County! Abolish ICE!</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Sunday, February 1, 2026 at 6:00 PM UTC - 7:30 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>California 1 &amp; Kansas Avenue<br>San Luis Obispo County, CA 93405</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Rally and vigil every Sunday between 10 am - 11:30 am at the corner of Hwy 1 and Kansas Avenue. Join us for a rally to protest ICE activity in our beloved community and to hold vigil for those in our community abducted by ICE. The sheriff chooses to allow ICE agents into the jail to abduct people despite CA laws that would allow him not to cooperate. The sheriff says he transferred zero people to ICE from January 2018 to December 2024. However, he reports 69 transfers in the secure area of the jail for 2025. These transfers do not include ICE abducting people released into the jail lobby which happens routinely. 

It IS happening here! ICE is in our community multiple times a week abducting people from the SLO County jail. Imagine you are waiting for a loved one to be released from the SLO county jail.  But before you can be reunited with them, they are kidnapped by masked secret police from the jail right before your eyes.

People taken at the jail are being denied due process and legal representation. They are separated from their children, families and loved ones. Don&apos;t turn your back on what is happening in our community. Everyone who is released from the jail should be released regardless of where they were born.

Thanks to those who spoke up at the Truth Act Forum on January 27 and those who showed up in solidarity. A subcommitee taking 60 days to dither is insufficient! At least 30 people can be kidnapped from the jail in that time. 

Bring large signs and banners centering calls for abolishing ICE and keeping it out of SLO and everywhere. If featuring signs with names of people murdered by ICE, please list all the people murdered by ICE. And the countless people harmed and disappeared whose names we do not know. Please stay off the road and stay safe. 

*A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.*</p>

<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Sidewalk on NW Stewart Parkway (In Front of Stewart Parkway Medical Building)<br>2460 NW Stewart Pkwy<br>Roseburg, OR 97471</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p># 🛑 RALLY AGAINST THE REGIME

## A Weekly Saturday Protest Against Authoritarianism

**Hosted by:** Indivisible Douglas County

**Date:** Every Saturday (some exceptions for the holidays)

**Time:** 12:00 pm to 2:00 pm

**Location:** 2460 NW Stewart Pkwy, Roseburg, OR 97471 (the sidewalk in front of Stewart Parkway Medical Building, across the street from McDonald&apos;s and Big O Tires)

⸻

## ✊ WHY WE RALLY

This is a weekly, sustained protest against the accelerating rise of authoritarian rule, state violence, and systemic corruption under the Trump administration.

We are rallying to confront:

- The construction of an authoritarian state that uses fear, surveillance, and force to silence dissent

- The mass targeting, criminalization, and disappearance of immigrants and vulnerable citizens carried out by the Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)

- The normalization of corruption, abuse of power, and rule-by-decree governance

- The genocide that continues to this day in Gaza and the West Bank under the ongoing military campaign by Israel against the Palestinian people, aided by the United States

This rally is about one core truth:

- Human rights do not depend on citizenship.

- Human dignity does not stop at borders.

- Democracy cannot survive corruption and terror.

⸻

## 🎯 WHAT WE ARE DEMANDING

We are calling for:

- An end to ICE and DHS being used as political weapons to terrorize our immigrant communities

- The abolition of ICE activity in the United States

- Full protection of due process, asylum rights, and constitutional liberties for all people within our borders

- An end to authoritarian governance, political repression, and state intimidation

- An immediate end to U.S. complicity in Israel’s genocide against the Palestinian people

- Real accountability for corruption, war crimes, and abuse of power—at every level

⸻

## 👥 WHO THIS RALLY IS FOR

- Immigrants, refugees, and their allies

- The Palestinian people and supporters of Palestinian liberation

- Veterans, faith leaders, workers, students, parents, and elders

- Whistleblowers, organizers, human rights defenders

- Anyone who refuses to live under authoritarian rule or corruption by the Trump administration

- Anyone against authoritarianism, fascism, and the abuse of power

- You do not have to be an activist.

- You just have to care about human lives and democratic freedom.

⸻

## 🕊 SAFETY, DISCIPLINE &amp; NONVIOLENCE

This is a peaceful, nonviolent protest, and that means:

- Everyone is responsible for their own de-escalation, as a safety team may not be available for every protest

- Do not take the bait of those who wish to antagonize us or our movement, disengage or remove yourself from conflict

- No physical engagement with counter-protesters

- No weapons of any kind

⸻

## 🪧 WHAT TO BRING

- Signs, banners, flags

- Justice-centered, anti-authoritarian, pro-human-rights messages

- Weather-appropriate clothing

- Water, sunscreen, medication

<h3>Tri-Valley Signs of Solidarity: Business Canvassing</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, February 3, 2026 at 6:30 PM UTC - 8:30 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Koffee Time<br>618 Main Street, Suite A, Pleasanton, CA 94566<br>Pleasanton, CA 94566</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Tri-Valley</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Join the Signs of Solidarity team to canvass local businesses, and ask them to post signs of support for our immigrant neighbors. 

There&apos;s been a significant increase in ICE agents entering small businesses without warrants and detaining people, including workers. It&apos;s created an environment where immigrants are often afraid to go to work or go shopping out of fear that ICE might show up. That&apos;s not how anyone in our community wants to live. Businesses should take steps to protect their workers and customers from these increasingly violent raids. 

No experience is necessary. A script is provided and a packet of signs; please bring a bag to carry them. You will receive a brief training and will be paired with an experienced canvasser. Please join us and and help to be part of the solution!

PLEASE NOTE: WE PLAN TO CANVASS IN MULTIPLE LOCATIONS IN THE TRI-VALLEY STARTING IN PLEASANTON ON JANUARY 27; HOWEVER, THE LOCATIONS WILL CHANGE WEEK TO WEEK.</p>

WHISTLES - A COMMUNITY SAFETY UPDATE
We love everyone&apos;s enthusiasm with their various noise-makers but note that whistles are now used for ICE warnings. In order to avoid undue fear, confusion or panic for our communities, please refrain from using whistles hereafter for any protest events.  Bells and horns are alternatives. 

Fight back against the Trump Regime and the extremist budget cuts, kidnappings by masked goons, and attempted military take-over of our cities, cuts to Medicaid and Medicare. Due Process for all! People over profit! Billionaires should not rule America. ICE/Military out of our communities! Bring your own sign!

These are nonviolent events. Each of us is responsible for our own conduct. Stay within your rights, don’t break laws, stay safe, stay peaceful, and avoid any risk you don’t feel comfortable with. Don’t obstruct traffic, protest inside any business, impede people from entering or exiting any property, or commit any acts of property damage. Ignore any counter protestors and stay focused on peacefully delivering our message. If you need help or see something troubling, tell a uniformed police officer or call 911. If you can safely do so, record troublesome behavior with your phone, as this is often a strong deterrent to bad behavior.</p>

<h3>ICE Out Protest: Super Bowl Edition</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 7, 2026 at 11:00 PM UTC - 12:30 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Gateway Plaza<br>790 W El Camino Real<br>Mountain View, CA 94040</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> It&apos;s Blue Turn</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>We will peacefully gather to stand up to this MAGA regime of bullies for billionaires that is destroying lives and undermining our country. We will demand that ICE be defunded and dismantled as a secret, masked police force that terrorizes people—especially people of color—across the country.  

We will gather to speak the truth and demand accountability and justice for the ongoing pattern of ICE violence and abuse.

We will:  
- Call for ICE to leave our communities  
- Build public pressure  
- Create space for grief, solidarity, and collective action  

We will share Know Your Rights cards, information on how to report ICE activity, and educational leaflet on how ICE has become a building block of authoritarianism so you can spread the word.

Please join us and bring your friends and neighbors. We need to be in the streets, showing how crucial it is that we defend democracy.

<h3>Demand Target Take a Stand: ICE out of MN and Everywhere</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, January 31, 2026 at 11:00 PM UTC - 12:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Target<br>4500 Macdonald Ave<br>Richmond, CA 94805</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Richmond Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>On January 31st, join us at a non-violent-action demonstration at the Richmond Target to hand out flyers and generate awareness of Target&apos;s complicity with ICE.

In Minnesota, and around the country, ICE is ripping immigrant families apart and killing American citizens in our streets. These despicable actions wouldn&apos;t be possible without the complicity or enablement of Trump&apos;s corporate backers. We need companies like Target to use their influence and pressure the administration to end the occupation of our cities and not bring their chaos anywhere else.

Target is Minnesota’s leading corporation and 4th largest employer. Where Target leads, others follow. Target donated $1,000,000 to Trump’s inauguration, rolled back DEI initiatives, and has reportedly allowed ICE to stage operations in its parking lots. On January 8th Customs and Border Patrol assaulted and kidnapped two US citizens while working a shift at the Richfield, MN Target store. For weeks, Target remained silent, while the community it calls home was terrorized, abducted, and killed. Last weekend, Target broke its silence and, disappointingly, joined the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce and 60 major Minnesota corporations in a statement calling for “cooperation” between state and federal governments. This is incredibly alarming, given that Attorney General Pam Bondi has defined “cooperation” to include granting the DOJ access to Minnesota voter rolls in the name of “ending the chaos” this administration violently created.

On Saturday, January 31, at the Richmond Target we will call on Target to stand FIRMLY with Minnesotans against these attacks. If they’re willing to kick community members out for sitting inside, they should kick out the immigration agents terrorizing our communities.

Target should:
•	Publicly call for ICE to immediately end its “surge” in Minnesota and for ICE &amp; Border Patrol to leave the state.
•	Affirm that it is a workplace that protects our 4th Amendment rights, post highly visible signage denying entrance to immigration agents who do not have signed judicial warrants as required by law, and train staff how to respond when immigration agents show up at stores.
•	Publicly call to shut down Trump’s ICE, and lobby Congress to reject additional funding for ICE in the upcoming Congressional budget, and for ICE to be investigated for human and constitutional rights violations of Americans and our neighbors.
•	Demand that any federal officer who kills or harms a civilian be held legally accountable.

A core principle behind all our events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events.</p>

<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Town &amp; Country Village<br>855 El Camino Real<br>Palo Alto, CA 94301</p>

Co-sponsored by Stand Up For Science And Sanity.

So what would you do if you had a budget of 27 billion dollars? Universal health care? Pay raise for teachers? Infrastructure investments? Decarbonize the power grid?

ICE&apos;s budget is 27 billion dollars, and they are using it to terrorize communities and murder Americans and non-Americans alike. Make no mistake: ICE&apos;s mission is to inspire fear, and they currently are paying absolutely no price for doing it.

Join us at Town &amp; Country this Friday at 4 pm to show Palo Alto that we will not stand idly by while our country is overrun by a masked band of thugs that answer to no one except Donald Trump.</p>

<h3>PROTEST ICE BEFORE SUPER BOWL FEB 8TH 11-12:30 RWC El Camino &amp; Jefferson</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Sunday, February 8, 2026 at 7:00 PM UTC - 8:30 PM</p>

<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Portola Valley</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>This will be a protest in Redwood City at El Camino and Jefferson Ave to support all cities--especially Minneapolis--that are standing up to ICE. Honoring those who were killed: Alex Pretti &amp; Renee Good and their families and friends. Another man shot in Arizona on the 27th and currently not named is in critical condition. And 6 who died in immigration detention just since Jan 1st! Honoring others who were arrested illegally and sent to secret jails where their families cannot find them.... There are rumors that ICE is coming to our area during Super Bowl as they want to punish us AND are losing their minds that Bad Bunny is the half time act and will sing in Spanish...so we need to be ready and show our power to stand up. If ICE is here by then we will have updates and more to do. I&apos;ll be updating this information.</p>

<h3>Pacific Grove Whistlemania</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Wednesday, February 11, 2026 at 1:00 AM UTC - 2:30 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>St. Mary&apos;s by the Sea Episcopal Church<br>146 12th St<br>Pacific Grove, CA 93950</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Monterey Bay</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>St. Mary&apos;s by the Sea Episcopal Church is partnering with Indivisible Monterey&apos;s WhistleSTOP Campaign to host another Whistlemania in Pacific Grove on Tuesday, February 10, from 5pm to 6:30pm. 

The event, which is free and open to all, gathers volunteers to assemble whistle kits for local community members to alert their neighbors when ICE is nearby. Join us! All ages welcome.

The WhistleSTOP Campaign is inspired by the collective action of thousands of community members in Chicago, Los Angeles, Charlotte and elsewhere who have been using whistles to alert their friends and neighbors when ICE is near or abducting someone.

By literally blowing the whistle on ICE we encourage others to gather and protect community members. Be loud and gather a crowd!

The WhistleSTOP Campaign has a goal of providing 100,000 whistles to local residents to help them alert others when ICE is near. Join us Tuesday, February 10 — together, we can protect our local community.

You can also contribute to these efforts by making a financial gift that will help us buy more whistles. Donate online here: https://onrealm.org/StMarysbytheSea/-/form/give/now</p>

The lunch is open to everyone connected with Indivisible San Mateo and will take place prior to our weekly Saturday street protests from 1 to 2:30 p.m., around the corner on El Camino at East 31st Avenue.  On the street, we&apos;ll be enjoying not only the very popular music of The Freedom Strummers but also the company of pro-democracy friends and the cacophonous sounds of solidarity from the passing honking horns.

The Terrace Dining area is on the second floor at the north end of the Mall, accessible by escalator and elevator.  There&apos;s ample parking at the Mall, lots of seating and lots of lunch options for those dining at one of the places in the food court.  The restaurants include Sarku Japan; Tacos E. Grullens; Hakata Kuro Obi Ramen; and Panda Express, among others.  There is also a Haagen-Dazs ice cream shop there.

Reservations are not necessary and all are welcome, whether for lunch or dessert or just fellowship for members of Indivisible San Mateo.  All are encouraged to be part of the rally afterward on El Camino around the corner.</p>

<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Tamalpais Overpass<br>100 Corte Madera Town Center<br>Corte Madera, CA 94925</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Resist And Defend</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>With the passage of the &quot;Big Ugly Bill,&quot; funding for ICE makes its budget more than the annual defense budgets for most other nations. We must protect our neighbors. Join us with banners in support of immigrants and promote the phone number of the Marin Rapid Response Network. See ICE? Call 415-991-4545.

Note that this is an active overpass. The goal is to make the banners visible to drivers on 101. 

This is a no-host event. An ad hoc group of citizen volunteers are facilitating this opportunity for Marin residents to peacefully and safely assemble in line with their First Amendment rights.

A core principle behind all Marin protest events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values. All participants agree to assume 100% responsibility for their own safety, conduct and well-being.</p>

<h3>Mill Valley #NoICENoWar</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Sunday, February 15, 2026 at 12:00 AM UTC - 1:30 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>47 N Knoll Rd<br>Mill Valley, CA 94941</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> May Day Strong</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Trump is waging war and committing murder to enrich his billionaire backers. We are fighting to stop him. **Stand with us and take action this weekend to demand an end to the occupation of Venezuela and our cities.** 

We’re focusing on corporate targets - companies set to benefit most from the occupation of ICE or Venezuela. 

This week, our target is **Hilton Hotels**, housing this administration&apos;s ICE goons.

**We stand united demanding an end to the Venezuelan occupation and the removal of reckless untrained ICE agents from our communities.** And we&apos;re taking our fight to the companies that are backing this administration and benefiting most.

**Together we will hit these companies in their pocketbooks, force the administration to end the occupation of Venezuela and our cities and spread the word to our neighbors that we deserve better.**

Every dollar spent in wars overseas or at home is a dollar we paid for with our taxes - a dollar that could and should go to helping our communities thrive. We can have good jobs, better schools, access to healthcare and get our basic needs met. But not while our government works for billionaires and not for us.

Join us, stand strong and speak up.

*Please note: A core principle behind all our events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events*</p>

<h3>Justice for Renée Good / Alex Pretti - ICE out of Home Depot Protest</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Sunday, February 1, 2026 at 7:00 PM UTC - 9:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Bicentennial Way &amp; Mendocino Avenue<br>Santa Rosa, CA 95403</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Sonoma County</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>On Wednesday, January 7th, an American citizen, Renée Good, was killed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Minneapolis, Minnesota. This killing is part of a broader pattern of unchecked violence, impunity, and abuse carried out by federal immigration enforcement agencies against members of our communities.

On August 14, 2025, Roberto Carlos Montoya died during an I.C.E raid in Monrovia, California. He was struck by a car and killed while being pursued by I.C.E. Almost immediately, DHS released a dishonest press release denying responsibility for Roberto&apos;s death. This is the second documented death during an I.C.E. raid. There have been numerous protests at Home Depot locations across Southern California. Now in solidarity, protests will begin at Home Depot locations in Northern California.

A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.

Rain cancels and no event on holiday weekends.</p>

<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Target - Santa Rosa South (public sidewalks)<br>500 Kawana Springs Road<br>Santa Rosa, CA 95404</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible Sonoma County</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>ICE OUT OF TARGET
Justice for Renee Good and Alex Pretti

Silence is complicity. It’s time to boycott and protest those corporations that comply with the fascist actions of this regime.
 
Protest on sidewalk, bring signs, whistles, and a friend!

*Why Protest Target?*

ICE Staging Locations in MN - It’s alleged that ICE is using Target parking lots to stage their MN operations

Employees are ICE Victims – Some Target employees are being detained, beaten in at least one case, and sent to detention centers 

Corporate cowardice and silence – Target’s corporate headquarters are located in MN. They have said nothing about the lawless actions being perpetrated by ICE in their hometown. (Note: They signed onto a wholly inadequate letter from a MN Business Leadership organization)

Protest Goals – Target needs to publicly oppose immigration activity on its premises, protect employees, and refuse to cooperate with ICE

<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>This a local Indivisible event!

Join us for a protest rally and visibility event SATURDAY, January 31 from noon until 2 p.m. at the old courthouse museum park in Lakeport.

The Trump regime is terrorizing our communities with brutal and often illegal immigration enforcement campaigns designed to test the limits of executive power and the nation’s willingness to stand up against this regime&apos;s power grab.  This pattern of unchecked violence and abuse by Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the Border Patrol, and other federal law enforcement agencies must end.
SPEAK OUT. Make your voice heard! We feel this is important in light of the public ICE execution and murder of Alex Pretti and Renee Good in Minneapolis, and multiple other deaths and injuries at the hands of this agency.

Reminder: Do not engage with motorists and do not impede traffic either on the sidewalk or on the street.

Bring a sign.Make somme noise.

Formerly known as the Monthly Learning Exchange, Food For Thought has been revamped for the election year of 2026! 

Food For Thought is a gathering on the 26th of every month where we host a catered dinner and a conversation about issues important to our community.

With the 2026 elections coming up fast, it&apos;s crucial that we come together to learn about and stand up for what will be on the ballot come August primaries and November midterms. 

This is the perfect opportunity to get involved, share ideas, and collaborate with like-minded individuals and organizations working towards a brighter future for our community.

As always, dinner will be provided as we come together to learn, connect, and inspire action. Whether you&apos;re a seasoned activist or just starting to get involved, these dinners are open to all who believe in unity and justice.

Don&apos;t miss out on this opportunity to be a part of creating real change in our community. Save the date | the 26th of every month

For more information, please visit standupalaska.org.

&quot;No one can do everything, but everyone can do something, and together we can change the world.” -- Ronald J. Sider.</p>

People classified as &quot;migrants&quot; are in the eye of the fascist storm sweeping across the world. As Trump tries to put a tyrannical, authoritarian regime in place, ICE has sent out plainclothed, masked gunmen to grab our neighbors, co-workers, and friends and disappear them into private, for-profit immigration jails. Children are being torn away from their parents - again. Migrants are being deported to random countries, paid by Trump to warehouse them. What is being done to migrants today is rapidly spreading to affect those of us classified as citizens. We must reject Trump&apos;s efforts to divide citizens from migrants. We do that by acting in solidarity and crushing Trump&apos;s ICE machine.</p>

<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p># IEB Adopt a Corner at Home Depot
## Defend Immigrants and Our Communities

IEB is working with Street Level Health Project and the Immigrant Defense Committee in Fruitvale to support Adopt a Day Labor Corner.  

Now is the time to show up for our neighbors by joining IEB&apos;s Adopt a Corner Team at Home Depot in Oakland. We provide you with training and orientation and we ask you to volunteer one 2-hour shift per week.  

ICE has been conducting raids at Home Depot stores across the country. Day laborers are the most vulnerable immigrants, risking their freedom to look for work and feed their families. 

Showing up for Adopt a Day Labor Corner is an important and challenging opportunity to support immigrants who risk ICE abductions, deportation and family separation.  Our presence at Home Depot can make a difference.

        <name>PETITION: Stop Secret Deportations and Stand for Due Process in America</name>
        <description><![CDATA[
<h3>PETITION: Stop Secret Deportations and Stand for Due Process in America</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, May 17, 2025 at 4:00 AM UTC - 4:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Mississippi Democratic Party</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>They say this is the land of the free—but in today’s America, people are being taken from their homes and communities without warning, without a lawyer, and without even a phone call.

Right now, under this administration, ICE agents are rounding up men, women, and even children—some of them U.S. citizens—without proper identification, without cause, and without any concern for our rights as Americans. 

They’re skipping courts. They’re skipping judges. They’re putting people on planes and shipping them out like they don’t matter.

This isn’t law and order. This is government overreach. And it’s not how things are supposed to work in a country that calls itself free.

We know what it’s like down here in Mississippi. We know what it feels like to be ignored, mistreated, and pushed to the side. Now ICE is doing the same to our neighbors, our church members, our coworkers, and our friends.

Nobody should be dragged off in the night with no hearing, no lawyer, no phone call.

Whether someone’s lived here ten years or ten generations, they deserve a fair shot. That’s just basic justice—and the kind of freedom our country is supposed to stand for.

Sign this petition and tell our elected leaders:

We want ICE held accountable. We want due process respected. And we won’t stand for secret deportations in our communities.

This is our home, and we’re not letting fear take it from us.</p>

        <name>ICE OUT OF ATX - Demand APD stop collaborating with ICE &amp; DHS</name>
        <description><![CDATA[
<h3>ICE OUT OF ATX - Demand APD stop collaborating with ICE &amp; DHS</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Wednesday, January 14, 2026 at 6:00 AM UTC - 6:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Hands Off Central TX - Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>We, undersigned, **call on the City of Austin to protect Austin residents from the violence of ICE and DHS** by immediately prohibiting the Austin Police Department from supporting any attempt by ICE or DPS to question, detain, and deport Austin residents and visitors.

We condemn the Austin Police Department&apos;s continued cooperation with federal law enforcement agencies who verifiably and repeatedly violate people’s constitutional rights, operate outside of their jurisdiction, and ignore due process.

We call on Austin City Council, Mayor Kirk Watson, and City Manager T.C. Broadnax to **immediately pass a city ordinance that prevents any APD employee from helping immigration agents** serving administrative warrants to Austin residents, including but not limited to:

Running a warrant check for ICE/DHS administrative warrants

- Serving ICE/DHS administrative warrants

- Detaining people on behalf of ICE/DHS

- Handing people over to ICE/DHS who are in APD custody

- Alerting these ICE/DHS to the location of Austin residents and visitors

We call on Austin Police Chief Lisa Davis to immediately **retrain the entire APD staff** to prevent city employees from knowingly or unknowingly notifying ICE of the residency address or current location of Austinites with ICE/DPS administrative warrants.

Austin Police Department’s assistance to ICE and DPS is quickly eroding the remaining trust Austinites have in our local government and local law enforcement. 

ICE and Border Patrol have **consistently escalated harm against civilians across the United States.** Here in Austin, they are racially profiling our communities, stopping Austin drivers without cause, and detaining and deporting our neighbors without due process.

Last week, the Austin Police Department responded to a 911 call. The department ran a warrant check for the women who had called them, which turned up an administrative immigration warrant. As a result, an **Austin mother and her child, who is a U.S. citizen, were taken into custody by federal immigration officials,** not allowed to share the details of their detainment with their family or local advocacy organizations, and deported even though the child is an American citizen.

This is only one of many stories from APD collaboration with federal immigration authorities.

If the City of Austin wants to claim that **our police department exists to serve and protect** our residents, the city should provide full transparency around the actions and policies of city employees, if city employees are even tangentially involved, when our neighbors go missing from their homes and workplaces.

APD in any way facilitating the detainment of Austin residents by any federal immigration department significantly impacts safety in our community by making it **less likely that immigrants, undocumented people, people of color, and anyone associated with the anti-ICE movement will report crimes** or cooperate with local law enforcement.

Immigration agents are increasing their violence and harassment of American residents, including undocumented immigrants, immigrants on valid visas, protestors, journalists, first responders, doctors, lawyers, bystanders, and legal observers. They have released chemical weapons into vehicles and on school property. They flagrantly and repeatedly violate their own use of force guidelines, act outside of their jurisdiction, and ignore due process altogether.

These agents and their lawlessness pose a significant bodily threat to the safety of every Austinite, and **we demand that the City of Austin act with expediency to prevent further detainment and deportations due to the actions of city employees.**

We demand city guarantees that the department is refusing to search for and serve ICE and DHS warrants, and new APD policies that materially protect Austin residents and visitors from ICE and DHS violence.</p>

<h3>Pledge to Strike: National Shutdown</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, January 20, 2026 at 5:00 AM UTC - 5:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> United We Dream Network</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>**This Friday, January 30th** we&apos;re joining a unified, nationwide economic strike in solidarity with Minnesota communities and the rest of the country being targeted by ICE. 

In the past 2 weeks, over 3,000 ICE agents terrorized our neighbors in Minnesota and took the life of Renee Nicole Good, a beloved community member and ally. Our tax dollars should never fund death and destruction in our own communities. 

**We know we deserve better.**

Our tax dollars should build accessible healthcare, create green spaces, and fund services that work FOR us, not against us. 

**This Friday, we’re calling on folks to:** 

- Stay home from work and school 🏠

- Refuse to shop or spend money in large corporations 💵❌

- Choose rest and community over businesses 💯

This is our chance to lead with our moral heart and show our collective economic power - let’s come together to say NO to increased ICE funding and YES to protecting each other. ❤️‍🔥

**If you can&apos;t miss work or need childcare,** please know that solidarity has many forms. Whether you strike for an hour, share this pledge, or contact your representative, your participation matters.  Resistance is built from whatever each of us is able to give. 

**Will you join the national shutdown? Will you bring your family and friends with you?** 🫵🏽

It takes all of us.

Pledge to join the strike and make your commitment to protect immigrants today!

**When you pledge, you will receive a link to printable posters and graphics that can be posted on social media.**</p>

<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Showing Up for Racial Justice</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>## We need to get organized – so organize your neighbors!

### Host a potluck with your friends, family, or neighbors to talk about what&apos;s happening and how to fight back against ICE. 
...............................................................................

One of the most important lessons we&apos;ve learned from Minneapolis is that forming connections, before things went down, was critical to community defense. So let&apos;s form those relationships!

We are asking folks to think of at least 3 people to bring together for a potluck, for coffee, or for a gathering, this weekend, to talk about what&apos;s been happening in Minneapolis, process together, and identify some concrete next steps for what to do about it. This is the first step to getting your community organized, and being able to fight back against ICE in the long haul. 

Are you in? Sign this commitment form if you&apos;re down, then follow the steps in our [toolkit!](https://act.surj.org/a/iceoutpotluck)


...............................................................................

_Showing Up For Racial Justice (SURJ) is the largest organization that explicitly organizes white people towards racial and economic justice - all are welcome to do our work with us. For more info, visit [surj.org](https://surj.org/)._</p>

<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> MoveOn</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Alex Jeffrey Pretti, Renee Nicole Good, Keith Porter, and many, many others have now been executed by President Trump’s ICE. The administration is murdering people in the streets for peacefully protesting to protect their neighbors and children. It’s heartbreaking and horrifying. Yet in the face of ICE’s brutality, Minnesotans aren’t giving up, they’re showing up. 

In freezing temperatures, tens of thousands of Minnesotans are taking the streets, delivering groceries to immigrant families, and joining together in community. Minnesota is leading the way, and MoveOn is coming together to stand with them.

Sign the pledge to take action against ICE, and be in solidarity with Minnesotans, and we&apos;ll be in touch with next steps.</p>

<p><strong>When:</strong> Friday, January 30, 2026 at 6:00 AM UTC - 4:59 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> SAAVE Texas</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>This is no longer political. It is a constitutional and moral crisis.
SAMPLE SCRIPT 

Hi, my name is [NAME], and I’m a South Asian constituent from [CITY, ZIP].

I’m calling because I am deeply concerned about the direction of this country. This is no longer politics — it is a moral, ethical, and constitutional crisis.

We have now witnessed two Americans, Renee Good and Alex Pretti, shot and killed by federal immigration agents, while countless others are dying in detention without ever having their day in court.

Armed, often unidentified agents are approaching South Asian families without warrants, without transparency, and without accountability. The line between constitutional law and unchecked force is being erased.

We demand that you act immediately to stop ICE’s lawless violence, defend constitutional protections, and refuse to fund abuse.

Texas is home to one of the largest South Asian populations in the country, and our communities are watching closely.

I demand that Senator Cornyn oppose any funding that expands ICE and push for immediate accountability and strict constitutional limits on enforcement.

OTHER DETAILS TO SHARE 
Congress must stop ICE now and defend the Constitution
South Asian communities are in deep fear and alarm as armed, often unidentified agents approach families without warrants, without transparency, and without accountability. The line between lawful enforcement and unchecked violence is being erased, and constitutional protections are being dangerously blurred.

We have now witnessed two Americans shot and killed by federal immigration agents, while countless others have died in detention without ever having their day in court. This breakdown of due process and rule of law threatens every community.

Texas is home to one of the largest South Asian populations in the country, and our families are watching closely.

We demand immediate action to stop ICE’s lawless violence, defend constitutional rights, and refuse to fund abuse.

Join us in calling Senators Cruz and Cornyn to demand accountability, constitutional protections, and an end to this crisis.</p>

<h3>Sick about ICE Terrorism? Let’s call our elected officials. Mondays, 12PM PST</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Monday, February 2, 2026 at 8:00 PM UTC - 8:30 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> CBFD Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Are you upset about the dismantling of our democracy, the violence perpetrated by I.C.E. on innocent people, the theft of millions of Americans’ private information, attacks on healthcare and social security, the Republican intent to take away a woman’s right to vote, and more? Don’t despair - take action!

One easy thing you can do that truly matters is make calls to your elected representatives, to let them know how you feel about an issue and what you expect them to do about it. Maybe you want to call your Member of Congress or your Senators but just haven’t done it yet. You know what you want, but you aren’t sure what to say.

Well, we’ve got a solution - a tool to help you make the calls, and to make your point. It’s also very rewarding because we’re doing it together. Join us every Monday on Zoom beginning January 5, 2026 at Noon Pacific time. We’ll provide all you need to make the calls - phone numbers, scripts, and training.  You’ll just need your phone, or your phone and your computer if you’d like a bigger screen for viewing.
 
We hope to see you on Zoom for this easy, effective action. Thirty minutes is all you’ll need to make sure our electeds know that we’re paying attention and demanding they take action.  There are millions of us across America - our collective voices will make a difference.  We’re in this together!</p>

<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> New York Working Families Party</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>From Onondaga County to New York City, the Working Families Party secured historic electoral wins this November -- and now the work has only just begun. The Trump Administration has slashed funding for critical services like SNAP and Medicaid, dumped millions of tax payer dollars into ICE, and is gearing up to cut more and more from our budget. New York State has the power and responsibility to STEP UP during the 2026 state budget and make the ultra wealthy pay their fare share so that we can fund the programs and services that allow NYers to thrive. Universal childcare, affordable housing, a true living wage, affordable and accessible healthcare are all possible and on the horizon for NYS. 

But we need YOU 🫵 to win.

Join us on Mondays at 6pm from January through April to build statewide power and directly contribute to NY WFP&apos;s strategy to advance policies that address the deep rooted economic inequalities in our state. 

Come ready to: lead virtual/in-person field events, sharpen your strategic decision making skills, deepen our collective political education, and meet likeminded volunteers across NYS.

NO PRIOR EXPERIENCE NECESSARY!</p>

<h3>ICE OUT For Good Indivisible Phone Bank</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, February 3, 2026 at 8:00 PM UTC - 10:00 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Masked federal agents are terrorizing our communities. They’re teargassing babies, kidnapping our neighbors, shooting clergy in the face with chemical projectiles, and killing innocent people.

**But right now, we have an opportunity to rein in ICE at the federal level.** ICE and Border Patrol are part of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). DHS funding expires at midnight on Friday, Jan. 30. Congress is currently negotiating how to fund DHS moving forward. Democrats met our first demand that DHS cannot be funded business as usual, and now we need Republicans to join them in finding the political will to meet this moment. This is our opportunity to put significant restrictions on ICE and ensure it doesn’t get a single penny more to enable its brutality.

**Join us on Tuesday, February 3, at 3 p.m. EST** to call voters in key states and encourage them to call their Republican senators to demand that they rein in ICE’s terror tactics.

<h3>Phone Bank for People&apos;s Champion Analilia Mejìa!</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, February 3, 2026 at 11:00 PM UTC - 2:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Showing Up for Racial Justice</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>## Come phone bank with SURJ!  
We&apos;ll be calling to **elect people’s champion Analilia Mejìa** who is running to represent New Jersey&apos;s 11th Congressional District.

Come as you are!  No experience needed!  Full training &amp; *lots* of support included!

......................................

## Logistics:
- These phone banks are online on the Zoom platform. Log into the call on Zoom on your computer and bring your phone to make the calls (if you only have one device, still come!). 
- We have a robust training on the call to give you all the information you need-- a script, technical support, and coaching throughout.
- Returners can start early. 
- You will receive an email with orientation materials ahead of time.
- ***Please note the time zone for call time***. 

......................................

## Feeling Unsure?

- **Our model works** - learn from the best! Our phone banks have one of the highest rates of success in the country. No matter whether you&apos;re a brand new caller or a seasoned organizer, if you join our banks, you can trust that you are putting your effort into a method that works. And you&apos;ll get to learn powerful organizing skills from seasoned leaders! 
- Our conversations are based on **open-ended questions** and **deep listening.** **You do not need to be an expert** on the issues or a candidate - our phone banks are successful because we deeply connect with voters and make them feel heard.
- Want to hear what a phonebank is like? Check out [**this video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3w4tNKPTY8) interviewing SURJ phonebankers.

......................................

## Context:

We are living in a historic time of the consolidation of authoritarian, billionaire-funded power in this country. At the same time, at every turn, **regular people have risen up, fought back**, and set a vision for what working people deserve: affordable healthcare, good schools, the right to live in our communities without fear. Since Trump’s election, **SURJ has been a part of meeting this moment**, from training thousands of white people in strategic noncompliance to fight ICE raids to recruiting thousands of newly-activated people into our movement. 

As they defund the social safety net and peddle more racist lies, millions of people are increasingly feeling the effects of the billionaire agenda. We know this fight is on multiple fronts, and **in 2026 we have an opportunity to harness the energy of the streets** – to not only wrest power from MAGA, but to ***put candidates in office who are willing to stand up to Trump and fight for working class people.***

This race will affect thousands of working class people and help set the tone going into the **2026 midterms**. Alongside our partners across the country, this is the time for our movements to offer a bold vision and bring our people into it.

......................................

## About SURJ:
[Showing Up for Racial Justice](https://surj.org/) (SURJ) is the largest organization in the country that explicitly organizes white communities for justice. Instead of choosing racism, silence, or complicity, we help white communities choose  justice. We have thousands of national members and 150+ chapters across the US and Canada.</p>

Sadly, our current leadership is busy tearing down our agencies and institutions, instead of building trust within our communities – both physical and demographic. I’m running for Lieutenant Governor because I believe in building a Texas that works for all of us—not just the well-connected few” – Vikki Goodwin

<h3>The Flip List: 2026 Strategy Session with Brady Quirk-Garvan</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Wednesday, February 4, 2026 at 11:00 PM UTC - 12:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Charleston County Democratic Party</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>Another boring Zoom? Absolutely not. 👀

The Charleston County Democratic Party is hosting a virtual strategy session with political strategist Brady Quirk-Garvan to break down which local seats are flippable in 2026 and what we can do to actually flip them. 

We’re talking real, local, specific analysis of:

📍 Flippable Charleston-area seats (with names, maps, and math)

🗺️ Where Democrats are already closer than most people realize

📊 What races you should prioritize and how we turn out voters and support our candidates

If you care about Charleston being a place where you can afford to live, the marsh still exists, your rights aren’t a seasonal debate topic, your libraries aren’t censored, your neighborhood survives climate change, and ICE isn’t roaming the streets, you need to be here. 

The midterms start now. Pull up.

Note: This event is a virtual meeting and the link will be provided via email after registration.</p>

<h3>Public School Strong Organizing Meeting</h3>

<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Public School Strong</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>**Over the past weeks and months, we&apos;ve seen the parents of public school kids harassed, abducted and deported on their way to pick their kids up from school.  We&apos;ve seen ICE pepper spray high school students and arrest educators on school grounds.  We&apos;re seeing proposed bills in states like Tennessee to use public schools to target immigrant families for deportation.**

**We&apos;ve also seen incredible bravery, solidarity and resilience on the part of students, parents, educators, and community members who have gone above and beyond to support and defend each other in the face of these federal invasions.**

We all have much to learn from those who have experienced these ICE surges, in cities like Durham, NC, Chicago, IL and Minneapolis, MN.

**Join us for the next Public Schools Strong organizing meeting on Tue, 2/10 to learn from leaders on the ground and get tools to protect your community and schools .**  

Public School Strong Organizing Meetings are a space for  parents, family members, educators, and public education supporters from across the nation gather each month to gain practical tools to promote, protect, and strengthen our public schools.

*If you have already attended a Public School Strong Orientation, you&apos;ll join a breakout room with current members for connection, reflection and training. If you&apos;re new, we&apos;ve got you covered too!*

### Join public school families, educators and supporters from across the country to learn how to:
1. Form a Public School Strong team in your school district
2. Engage your community to get school boards and district leaders to speak up for equitable and fully funded public schools
3. Connect your local advocacy to others for state and national impact

<p><strong>When:</strong> Wednesday, February 11, 2026 at 9:00 PM UTC - 9:45 PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Seattle Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p># Join Seattle Indivisible for a Critical Discussion with Senator Cantwell&apos;s Staff

Join Seattle Indivisible for an engaging Zoom discussion and Q&amp;A session with staff from Senator Maria Cantwell&apos;s office. As we navigate a complex political landscape in 2025, several key issues demand our attention:

Key Issues in 2026
🧊 Paramilitary Forces Attacking Immigrants and our Cities
ICE and CPB waging illegal, violent campaigns against immigrants and Black and brown people. 


🏛️ Constitutional Concerns
The ongoing failure of institutions to protect our rights and programs established by Congress have raised serious questions about the erosion of democratic principles.

💰 Economic Uncertainty
The imposition of a federal spending freeze has led to confusion and legal challenges, impacting various programs and contributing to fiscal instability.

⚖️ Social Equity
Policies targeting marginalized communities, including restrictions on transgender rights and potential cuts to social safety nets, underscore the ongoing struggle for social justice.

Senator Cantwell has been a vocal advocate for protecting democratic institutions, promoting economic stability, and advancing social equity. This session offers a unique opportunity to engage directly with her staff on these pressing issues.

📢 Your participation is crucial in voicing concerns and influencing decisions that impact our community.

We look forward to your active involvement in shaping the future of our state and nation!</p>

Koonin takes listeners behind the headlines, dispels popular myths, and unveils little-known truths.

In order to stave off the mass extinction of species, including our own, we must move swiftly to preserve the biodiversity of our planet.

<h3>Urge Your City Council to SHUT DOWN Flock</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 14, 2026 at 5:30 PM UTC - 5:30 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Southend Indivisible</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>THIS EVENT IS NOW AND ONGOING (ignore posted date/time)

With the first city council meetings of 2026 beginning, right now is a critical opportunity to urge your council to protect their constituents from Trump&apos;s ICE goons. 

ALPR (Automated License Plate Reader) cameras - i.e. Flock and Axon - have been widely reported by local and national media as being used - often secretly - by ICE to collect data meant only for local police departments. A UW study unveiled that ICE accessed Flock data​​ in at least 18 WA cities: jsis.washington.edu/humanrights/2025/10/21/leaving-the-door-wide-open

It&apos;s now clear these cameras give ICE a powerful surveillance tool to kidnap our neighbors, making all of us LESS safe.

Email your city council with a simple ask: &quot;Shut down ALPR cameras.&quot;

<h3>Talk to our Neighbors about ICE: Phone Bank with SURJ!</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, February 17, 2026 at 11:00 PM UTC - 2:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> Showing Up for Racial Justice</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p>#### Right now is the time to intervene.  To step up.  To move our people.

As the Trump Administration continues to deploy violent ICE agents to our nation&apos;s cities, we remain clear and centered on the following truths:

1. White working class Americans have so much to gain by standing in solidarity with our immigrant neighbors.
2. Trump’s aggressive and violent deployment of ICE is causing many white working class communities to re-evaluate their views and beliefs on immigration.
3. Listening-forward conversations that support people to reflect on their values, feelings and experiences can shift their attitudes, perspective and behavior.

That&apos;s why we&apos;re channeling these truths into a powerful action that you can take with us.

**Join SURJ to talk to key white working class voters about their feelings on Trump’s immigration policies and deployment of ICE in the key congressional districts  that will determine control of the House in the 2026 elections.**

Together, we can move the needle and build power.  No prior experience needed – we’ll provide all the resources,  training and support you need to phone bank with us to have these critical conversations at a critical juncture for shaping public opinion and our society’s commonsense beliefs around immigration policy</p>

<p><strong>When:</strong> Thursday, February 19, 2026 at 11:00 PM UTC - 12:00 AM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><br>Location not specified</p>
<p><strong>Organized by:</strong> State Voices Florida</p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p><p># ¡TODOS TENEMOS DERECHOS!

## Seas ciudadano o no, la ley te protege.

Únete a nosotros el **18 de Septiembre** a las **6PM EST** en una capacitación gratuita para:

- Conocer tus derechos frente a oficiales de inmigración (en casa, en la calle o en un vehículo).
- Aprender cómo protegerte y preparar a tu familia.
- Informarte sobre las nuevas leyes en Florida que afectan a nuestra comunidad.

 En Florida, todos los condados firmaron _acuerdos 287(g)_ con ICE, lo que significa que la policía local puede actuar como agentes de inmigración incluso en paradas de tráfico. Además, nuevas leyes aumentan las penas contra inmigrantes y limitan el acceso a la educación para estudiantes indocumentados.

Pero no estamos solos. Al informarnos y compartir este conocimiento, podemos cuidarnos entre todos.

En este taller recibirás una Guía de Conozca Sus Derechos (KYR) clara y práctica para protegerte y apoyar a tu comunidad.</p>

Join Seattle Indivisible for an engaging Zoom discussion and Q&amp;A session with staff from Senator Maria Cantwell&apos;s office. As we navigate a complex political landscape in 2025, several key issues demand our attention:

Key Issues in 2026
🧊 Paramilitary Forces Attacking Immigrants and our Cities
ICE and CPB waging illegal, violent campaigns against immigrants and Black and brown people. 


🏛️ Constitutional Concerns
The ongoing failure of institutions to protect our rights and programs established by Congress have raised serious questions about the erosion of democratic principles.

💰 Economic Uncertainty
The imposition of a federal spending freeze has led to confusion and legal challenges, impacting various programs and contributing to fiscal instability.

⚖️ Social Equity
Policies targeting marginalized communities, including restrictions on transgender rights and potential cuts to social safety nets, underscore the ongoing struggle for social justice.

Senator Cantwell has been a vocal advocate for protecting democratic institutions, promoting economic stability, and advancing social equity. This session offers a unique opportunity to engage directly with her staff on these pressing issues.

📢 Your participation is crucial in voicing concerns and influencing decisions that impact our community.

We look forward to your active involvement in shaping the future of our state and nation!</p>
